            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Here preſent to You a Gentleman very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his Extraction, but unfortunate under his preſent
<pb facs="tcp:65930:3"/>
Circumſtances; who, after having, in vain, ſought for Relief among his Country-Men, whom he ſerved to the prejudice both of his Honour and Eſtate, has now taken a Reſolution to try his Fortune once more in <hi>England.</hi> The Character wherewith You have been lately dignify'd by the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Kingdom, is an ample Teſtimony of what ſhare this Noble City bears in Your happy Succeſs in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the late Storm raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt You, and Your Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Appearance in this Station, (beyond what was ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by any of Your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors) but above all, Your
<pb facs="tcp:65930:3"/>
Noble Mind in Relieving thoſe in Diſtreſs, as it ſufficiently juſtifies their choice, ſo it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles You in a moſt peculiar manner to the Protection of a Gentleman, groaning under the weight of Affliction. True Generoſity is like a large Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which ſending forth its Branches into the circumjacent Countries, renders them Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, Vertue is its own Reward, and a Man truely Vertuous, will ſcarce ever make the Popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, the Standard of his Actions, but it is alſo undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb facs="tcp:65930:4"/>
that there are certain Vertues, ſuch as Succouring the Unfortunate, Relieving thoſe in Diſtreſs, and affording ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Food to ſuch as labour under heavy Afflictions, which as they tend to the general Benefit of Mankind; ſo they ought not to be bereaved of their due Praiſes, but to be made Conſpicuous in their beſt Luſtre, to excite in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a moſt commendable Emulation of doing Good. Of this we have ſeen the happy Effects in Your own Perſon, Your Bounty and Charity towards ſo many Priſoners in Diſtreſs, has had
<pb facs="tcp:65930:4"/>
ſo powerful an Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, as to ſerve them for an encouragement to follow Your Noble Example. This happy Influence is ſo far from being confined within the Bounds of this Nation, that it has extended its Effects to our neighbouring Kingdoms and States. The Worthy Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Dublin</hi> are amongſt the number of thoſe, who being ſtirr'd up by Your generous Example, have endeavour'd to follow Your Foot-ſteps in Releaſing a good Number of Priſoners of that City; and who knows but it may have ſome good Effect upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable

            <p>It is this, SIR, which has encouraged our Gentleman in Diſtreſs, to Court Your Patronage, in hopes, that Your favourable Acceptance of what he offers to Your Protection, may at leaſt prove a ſeaſonable Comfort to him in the Extremity of his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſince by his ill Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by the Remoteneſs of the Place, but above all, by the

ſeverity of thoſe for whom he had Sacrificed all, he is bereaved of that Relief which he might reaſonably expect from the more happy Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our Government, and from the Generoſity of ſuch a Patron as Your Self, I cannot but promiſe my ſelf a favourable acceptance from Your Generoſity, which has been ſo univerſal, as not to be comprehended within the narrow compaſs of an Epiſtle, which obliges me to Acquieſce with an intire confidence in Your Protection which next to a hearty wiſh for Your everlaſting Proſperity, is the

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE the firſt Publiſhing of this Treatiſe, it has been no ſmall diſpute amongſt thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the moſt competent Judges of a matter of this nature, whether the Author's intention had been to give us a true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, or a piece participating both of the nature of a Novel and a Hiſtory; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince the Bookſeller of <hi>Cologn,</hi> unto whom the Copy was firſt tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, has either not thought fit, or not been able to give any ſatisfactory Account
<pb facs="tcp:65930:7"/>
upon this head. The beſt way I can propoſe to the Reader for the deciding of this Queſtion, will be, to have recourſe to the Book it ſelf, and to endeavour to inform his own Judgment concerning the moſt remarkable head it contains, of which many are of ſuch a nature, as cannot be long concealed to the World, there being ſo many living Witneſſes in <hi>England, Germany, France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who are unqueſtionable Judges, either of the Falſity or Truth of thoſe matters.</p>
            <p>Thus much is agreed on all hands, that his Relation is ſincere in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to his own Affairs, even to his Perſonal Infirmities, of which he gives a moſt particular Account without the leaſt diſguiſe; but ſome of the Wiſer ſort have made this Obſervation, that his Judgment is often miſguided by Paſſion, or fondneſs of entering upon digreſſions, when he ſpeaks of others, though Perſons of an eminent Rank,
<pb facs="tcp:65930:7"/>
an inſtance of which may be given in ſome certain Paſſages relating to the late D. of <hi>Sh</hi> . . . . . . which are of ſuch a nature, as to be contradictory to what the greateſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> was convinc'd of in relation to his conſtant Zeal for the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he always profeſs'd from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</p>
            <p>'Tis agreed of by moſt, that if the Relation he gives us in the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Spy, be genuine, (as by its Character it ſeems to be ſo) nothing could be more natural, or proficious; for never any Spy in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, took ſo much pains to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask himſelf, and to repreſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in its true, natural, ugly ſhape, and the Reward that commonly is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thoſe who follow this Trade. Upon this occaſion I cann't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to take notice how, within theſe few Years, foreign Generals have been repreſented upon the Stage in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb facs="tcp:65930:8"/>
Nations (where they pretend to a particular privilege of ridiculing all the World beſides themſelves) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Crown-piece</hi> to a Spy for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſervices. I am apt to believe, the Author of theſe Memoirs would have been well ſatisfied, if they had given him no worſe Reward, for having ſacrificed both his Honour and Eſtate for their Intereſt: A convincing inſtance, that ſome Princes ſtand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes more indebted to their propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stars, than to the Rewards they beſtow upon thoſe that ſerve them. Some who pretend to be acquainted withour Author's Perſon, have this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that being of very low Stature, very hard favour'd in his Phyſiognomy, very lean, and beſides this, disfigured by a wound in his Face, they cannot conceive what ſhould make the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo fond of his Perſon, as to be Debauch'd by, or Married to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that made ſuch an indifferent
<pb facs="tcp:65930:8"/>
Figure; or Princes to be ſo taken with him, as to beſtow theſe Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon an unknown Perſon. This might be eaſiely anſwered, if it be granted that his Deſerts and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Converſation did make amends for the defects of his Body; but that ſome among the Criticks have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more indiſcretion in his Writings than they believe to be conſiſtent with ſuch a Character, unleſs it be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his behalf, that the irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo long an Impriſonment might cauſe a change in his Temper.</p>
            <p>But without inſiſting any further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point, even the niceſt Criticks cannot refuſe to acknowledge, that theſe <hi>Memoirs</hi> are full of agreeable and moſt pleaſing turns, that great variety of Accidents ſo naturally and lively repreſented; his Actions in the quality of a Spy, and his Diſcoveris of what daily paſſes in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> are ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:65930:9"/>
as muſt needs both delight and inſtruct the <hi>Reader,</hi> For the reſt, as his Stile is more Natural than Learned, ſo what it wants in exactneſs, it makes up in its perſpecuity, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine purity, and if he had been more careful in aſſigning the exact times of ſome things contained in this Relation, it would have been free from all obſcurity, which ſeems to remain in ſome few paſſages, to thoſe who will not take the pains to compare them in all their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>

                  </gap>d in the Service of the late Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> he commited me to the care of a Curate of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pariſh, which was his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>This Curate happen'd to have a Niece in the ſame Houſe with him, who being about four or five Years older than I, we play'd the Fool together ſo long, till ſhe was brought to Bed of a luſty Child.</p>
               <p>Being thereby obliged to leave her Unkle's Houſe, I returned to my Father, who was ſo far from chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, that he uſed to laugh at it: This ſerv'd me for no ſmall Encouragement to continue my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Debauched courſe of Life; ſo true it is, that young People ought to be check'd in the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I being then but 16 Years old. But it was not long before I began to be weary of living at my Father's Houſe, which made me take a reſolution to go and try my Fortune in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> where I had a Kinſwoman Married to a Perſon, who made at that time a very conſiderable Figure there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65930:10"/>This was Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> Intendant of the Finances, a vaſt Rich Man, and one who Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Fortune every Day: He was all in all with Mounſieur <hi>de la Vicuville,</hi> Sur-intendant of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, who by reaſon of his great Age, left the whole Management of Affairs to his Conduct. I was very kindly received by Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> who would needs have me lodge in his Houſe, and gave me every Day freſh marks of his Friendſhip; ſo that he offer'd to lay down half the Money for the Purchaſe of a Counſellor's Place in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, believing my Father to be in a Condition to ſupply the reſt, which he declined, by reaſon of his Incapacity to furniſh ſuch a Summ. I reſolved therefore to enter my ſelf as a <hi>Cadee</hi> in the Regiment of the Guards, in the Company of <hi>Pradelles.</hi> I lived thus very handſomly, being furniſhed with Money by Mounſieur <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who, as he was very well known to the King, and well conſidered by the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> then chief Miniſter of State, ſo he introduc'd me to them both.</p>
               <p>This Regiment was ſometime after Commanded to Reinforce the Siege of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> where I was wounded above the Groin: Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> his Son, being at that time Intendant of the Army, and lodged in the ſame Caſtle where the King's Quarters were; I was carried to his Quarters, and he was ſo obliging, as to ſend Mounſieur <hi>Bontems</hi> his Gentleman to enquire after the preſent ſtate of my Health. It was a conſiderable time before this Wound could be cured; and the Army being in the mean while obliged to Decamp, I obtained a Paſs from the Enemy, in order to be convey'd to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before Married to a young Lady, who being not above 12 Years old, lived in the ſame Houſe with his Father. I was alſo carried thither, which proved a great obſtacle to my recovery: For ſhe uſed frequently to viſit me, with ſome other Ladies, her Companions, among whom there was one I had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65930:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a moſt particular reſpect for above the reſt, and as ſhe uſed often to ſit down near me, ſhe would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably have occaſion'd the loſs of my Life, if it had continued thus much longer; but the Chyrurgeon having gueſt at the matter, forbid any Woman to be admitted into my Chamber for the future.</p>
               <p>After I was recovered of my Wound, the King, who at that time, in ſome meaſure, ſaw Tranquility reſtor'd in his Dominions, which for a conſiderable time had been harraſſed by Inteſtine Broils, did to ſatisfie his Warlike Inclinations, order a Fort to be Erected in the Gardens of the <hi>Thuellerie,</hi> where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral mock Attacks were made under the Conduct of Mounſieur <hi>de Puiſſigny.</hi> As I was Employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of the Guards, that uſed to be Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in this Place, in the King's preſence, ſo I had ſeveral times the honour to ſpeak to him, and he promis'd me an Enſigns place in the Guards, which however I never obtain'd; the Cardinal, who ſold every thing, diſpoſing of all the Vacancies for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: The old Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> was not well ſatisfied with it, becauſe he would willingly have purchaſed one for Money, if he had known that he would have accepted of any upon my account.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-Law, being Courted by ſo many Suitors in her Husbands abſence, (who was gone in the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Envoy Extraordinary from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) found her ſelf under an obligation to retire for ſome time to <hi>Neuville,</hi> whither I was ſent along with her, by the old Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux.</hi> Here they had a very fine Seat, which coſt them above 25000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling, being not above 10 Leagues from <hi>Paris;</hi> we uſed to paſs our time very pleaſantly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, being both of an Age, moſt inclinable to Pleaſure; tho' for Six Months together we ſcarce ſaw any body, but ſuch as belonged to the Family; and her Father-in-law who was not ignorant of the frailty of the Fair Sex, had allowed her no more than four or five Female Companions. At laſt one <hi>Pecourt,</hi> a Dancing Maſter, happening to come from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65930:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> with ſome young Gentlemen to pay us a Viſit, the old Gentleman, who was appointed by his Son to have a watchful Eye upon all her Actions, was ſo much diſpleaſed at it, that he ordred her immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not long after that I was engaged in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with one St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> on the account of Mr. <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> of whom he ſpoke Ill in my preſence; upon which we both ſides drew our Swords, and I did run him through the Body. Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing more kindneſs to me than ever upon this account, took care to have me ſecretly convey'd to <hi>Neuville,</hi> becauſe the Wounds of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be mortal.</p>
               <p>Tho' by the ill ſucceſs of the late Battle, fought by the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> near St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Flames of the Civil War were in ſome meaſure ſuppreſs'd, yet there were ſome remainders, which nothing but time could entirely extinguiſh. Among other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, the Flat Country was expoſed to the depredations of the Soldiers, ſo that the Inhabitants were forced to tranſport their moſt precious Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles into places of Safety.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe living near <hi>Neuville,</hi> having ſent their beſt Effects to that place, a certain Company of Stragglers, had laid a deſign to ſurprize and pillage the Place in the following manner: They ſent in the Evening ſome of their Gang, to deſire a ſafe retreat with their Carts and Goods, pretending they came from <hi>Montfort Lamauri,</hi> which is not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from thence, in hopes that their requeſt would be granted without any difficulty; they had laid ſome of their Gang in an Ambuſh, who as ſoon as the Carts ſhould be entred the Gates, and paſs the Bridge, ſhould ſurprize the Caſtle. But I being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that time, gave them for Anſwer, that I could not let down the Draw-Bridge at that time of the Night; that as for their Perſons they ſhould be admitted into the Gates immediately, but that their Carts muſt keep without till it was broad day. In the mean while day-light began to appear, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65930:12"/>
they having again deſired admittance into the Caſtle, I order'd that four or five of them at a time ſhould paſs over a little Draw-Bridge; whereupon thoſe that were in Ambuſh perceiving ſome hurry among the Carts, and verily believing that the great Draw-Bridge was let down, all on a ſudden advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle: which being perceived at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by a Centinel from his Watch Houſe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there for that purpoſe, he cried out that they ſhould draw up the Bridge, we being in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſurpriſed; which being done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, thoſe that were entred before were made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and put in a Dungeon; the others were ſo welcom'd by our Guns, that they were glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. I immediately diſpatch'd a Meſſenger to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> to let him know what was paſs'd, and what was to be done with the Priſoners, who ſent me word that I ſhould ſet them at liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to throw away his Money to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them: His Indulgence was not very pleaſing to me, who would rather have ſeen them rewarded with a Halter.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, St. <hi>Lewis</hi> being recovered of his Wounds, I returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I met with a moſt kind reception from Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux.</hi> It was much about the ſame time the Cardinal made a Propoſition to him that in caſe he would advance him Four Millions of Livers, he would make him Sur-Intendant, in conjunction with Monſieur <hi>De Vicuville,</hi> who by reaſon of his great Age and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, was forced to commit the management of the Finances to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad of ſuch an advantagious offer. For which reaſon he took up what Money he could among his Acquaintance and he had already raiſed the greateſt part of the Summ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the ſudden death of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Vicuville</hi> wrought a great change in the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>For the Cardinal who ſtood in need of Money, ſent to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> to know whether he was ready to perform his promiſe; who having anſwer'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65930:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he wanted ſome part of it, the Cardinal made the ſame Offer to the Sieurs <hi>Servien</hi> and <hi>Fouquet,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to furniſh the demanded Summ, were made Sur-Intendants in the room of Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> who thereby loſt much of his Credit, and was forc'd to reſt ſatisfied with his place of Intendant, which could not be taken from him.</p>
               <p>This Diſgrace, of which the Son bore his ſhare, as being not for the future to be furniſh'd with ſuch large ſupplies of Money as before, was encreas'd by another, which happen'd much about the ſame time in his Lady's Family. For her Father, who had the Reputation of one of the Richeſt Bankers, and who was Receiver General of the Finances at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> came to fail, being forced to ſhelter himſelf in the Palace of <hi>Guiſe</hi> againſt his Creditors. His Son-in-law, who before was not very fond of his Wife, became after this diſappointment more averſe to her than ever; being ſenſible that both his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Intereſt muſt needs ſuffer conſiderably, by his Father-in-law being become a Bankrupt. For, beſides that he was thereby depriv'd of all hopes of any farther Advantage after his Death, which had been his chief motive to Marry his Daughter, he loſt beſides this part of her Portion which he had left in his Hands.</p>
               <p>I for my part, bore alſo my ſhare in their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tho' in a different way. For one of the Officers employed under Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> the Elder, put it into his head, that I was in Love with his Daughter-in-law; whereupon, without any further conſideration, he reſolved to ſend me to his Son in <hi>England.</hi> But for fear I ſhould make any difficulty to conſent to it, he inſinuated into my Father, that the Cardinal was very angry with me, becauſe I had let fall ſome words, complaining that he had not been mindful of the King's promiſe to me. My Father being over perſwaded by him, order'd me to get every thing ready to go along with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> where he was to buy ſome Horſes for the Cardinal, Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> having recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65930:13"/>
him to his Eminency, as one the beſt skill'd in Horſes of any Man living; which indeed was no more than the Truth, there being ſcarce any body who excell'd him in this point. To be ſhort, our Journey proved very unfortunate: We came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> juſt after the Packet-boat was ſailed for <hi>England,</hi> ſo that we were under a neceſſity to lay hold of the next conveniency of a Veſſel bound for <hi>London,</hi> Thus by the Intrigues of a miſchievous Tongue, I ſaw my ſelf diſappointed of the hopes of making my Fortune near the King.</p>
               <p>But as one ill fortune ſeldom comes alone, we were not long after in moſt eminent danger of having been Shipwrack'd; For the Wind blowing very hard from the South-Weſt, we were drove e'en upon the Sands in ſight of <hi>Pettem</hi> on the <hi>Dutch</hi> Coaſt. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhed our ſelves a little on ſhoar, we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board; and being got clear by the help of the Tide, we were ſoon after, by a moſt violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, forced upon the Coaſt of <hi>Norway.</hi> The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt was ſo terrible, that for four or five Days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we were not able to diſtinguiſh Day from Night, till the fury of the Storm being ſomewhat abated, the Seamen deſcry'd at a great diſtance the City of <hi>Bergen,</hi> the Capital of the Kingdom of <hi>Norway.</hi> The Ship having ſuffered conſiderable Damage in the late Tempeſt, it was reſolved to take the Harbour; which being done, the Ship was fain to be laid up, in order to be Refitted. The great Froſt, which happen'd in a few days after, and which render'd that Port unpaſſable, made us take up our Quarters there for the whole Winter, and we lodged at the Houſe of a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, living in that City.</p>
               <p>As he had good Correſpondence in <hi>France,</hi> we took this opportunity to let our Friends there know what was befallen us; and he being inform'd by ſome of his Correſpendents of my Fathers Quality, was very deſirous to marry me to his only Daughter. This Merchant paſſing for a vaſt Rich Man in this Country; my Father, who hop'd to have found a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65930:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
means to make my Fortune, did give ear to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and the Daughter ſhew'd much more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to me, than to any of that Country, but I had not the ſame favourable Sentiments for her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; her whole diſpoſition appearing to me, as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage as the Country ſhe Inhabited; it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to give you a true <hi>Idea</hi> of the unpoliteneſs of the Inhabitants of that Country; for moſt of them run away at the very ſight of a Stranger, and to me they appear'd, at a diſtance, more like Bears than Men. My Father did all he could to move this ſqueamiſhneſs of mine, telling me, <hi>that a Man of Fortune muſt paſs by abundance of thoſe Matters to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorate his Condition;</hi> but to little purpoſe. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I ſhould queſtionleſs have found it a hard task to have got rid of my intended Spouſe, if her Father had proved as rich as we at firſt Imagined. But when my Father began to ſound the bottom, and what Portion he intended to give his Daughter, we found that there was not much ready Caſh, his Riches conſiſting chiefly in his Book Debts, and ſome Lands in <hi>Norway.</hi> In the mean while, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was gone ſo far as to be almoſt paſt retreating; the only pretext he had left to gain time was, that he was unwilling to conclude the Matter without the advice of his Relations. Thus the buſineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and the Spring coming on, we got on board again, in order to purſue our Voyage.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſaw my ſelf delivered from a Country, where I was afraid I ſhould have ended my Days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Bears; for, to ſpeak Truth, I could ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe there but theſe Beaſts and Sorcerers. The laſt are ſo common in that Country, as with us the ſhooe-makers or any other Artificers. They ſell Wind to the Maſters of Ships, juſt as they are ready to ſet ſail; and that not in private, as forbidden Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities us'd to be diſpos'd of in other places, but in Publick; no otherwiſe, than as if they ſold you one of the Products of their Country. Our Maſter of the Ship purchas'd ſome as well as the reſt, which indeed, could not but ſurprize me to a high degree,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65930:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſee thoſe People ſo void of all fear of offending God Almighty, as to put their Confidence in, and to ſacrifice to the Devil.</p>
               <p>Being at laſt ſafely arrived at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> we got aſhoar, making the beſt of our way to <hi>London</hi> upon ſome Hackney-Horſes, which our Hoſt there had provided for us.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing we did, was to viſit Monſieur <hi>De Bordeaux,</hi> who received us very kindly, and would needs have us ſtay with him in his Houſe. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Gallant, he uſed to pay frequent Viſits to the Ladies; ſo that for five or ſix Months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I did little elſe but ſpend my time in viſiting with him. I had a moſt peculiar Genius for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, which in a Years time, I knew as well as if I had been a Native of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> had at that time a Miſtriſs, a Knight's Lady, whoſe Husband having conceiv'd ſome Jealouſie at their Converſation, had left her, and, as it was given out, was gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> to viſit all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> to ſatisfie his Curioſity, which had been always bent to Travelling. But about three Months after my arrival, as Monſieur <hi>de Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> and I were coming one day from viſiting this Lady, a Muſquetoon was diſcharg'd at our Coach, the Bullets of which paſſed from before, where the Coachman's Seat is, through the Coach where the Footmen are commonly plac'd, without doing any harm, but to wound the Coachman: Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> and I having not receiv'd the leaſt Hurt, and the Footmen alſo having eſcap'd the danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had, to their good Fortune, juſt a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before left the Coach, and were walking by. There was no body that could give the leaſt account of the Author of this intended Murther; ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the ſame to proceed from a certain Perſon, who bore the Character of an Envoy of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> others gave out, that this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Husband being return'd out of <hi>Italy,</hi> intended to beſtow this upon us as a Recompence, for the Pains we had taken to dignifie him with Horns;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65930:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the laſt indeed, ſeem'd to be the moſt probable.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I did nothing but loſe time, without the leaſt proſpect of Advancement in this Country, when a ſudden Accident happen'd which prov'd to my advantage. For one <hi>Crible,</hi> who was come out of <hi>France</hi> with Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> in the Quality of Secretary, ſtabb'd his Butler with a Knife, and was forc'd to fly the Country to avoid puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> after he had for ſome time reſided in <hi>England,</hi> in the Quality of an Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary from <hi>France,</hi> was of late dignify'd with the Title of an Ambaſſadour, and had obtain'd the Place of Secretary of the Embaſſy for this <hi>Crible.</hi> His Excellency, after having given Advice to the <hi>French</hi> Court of what had happen'd with <hi>Crible,</hi> obtain'd the Place for me, of which accordingly I took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Being but very young, the Envoy of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> did propoſe to himſelf to improve it to his Advantage; for which reaſons, knowing that I us'd ſometimes to viſit Madam <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65930:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he remain'd fully perſwaded, he had gain'd his end; and I took moſt particular care, to remove all ſuſpicion he might have conceived of the good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the Protector.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, he was as yet unreſolved at that time, as to the deſired Succours; being, not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, afraid, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, who bare an old Grudge to the <hi>French,</hi> which is not eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, would not look upon it with a very good eye. For which reaſon it was that Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> was forced to make his Applications to <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Harriſon,</hi> his intimate Friends, who being brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to our ſide by a good round Summe of Money, perſwaded the Protector to conclude a Defenſive League with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By vertue of this Treaty he obliged himſelf to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us with thirty Men of War in caſe of neceſſity, and to join 6000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot with the <hi>French</hi> Troops. This League was brought to perfection, ſome time after the arrival of Monſieur <hi>de Baſs</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> He came under pretence of Complimenting the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, but it is certain that he had ſome ſecret Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which I was never able to learn. A certain mark of his being ſent upon a more important Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand than a bare Compliment, was, that ſoon after he changed his Quality of appearing as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Eminency, as he did at firſt, into that of an Envoy Extraordinary of <hi>France,</hi> with Orders to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> not to tranſact any thing of moment without his Advice.

Colonel <hi>Gerard</hi> drew his Sword to taken ſatisfaction for the affront, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, who was in his Company, was ſlain in the fray, before they could be parted. Colonel <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> hereupon challenged the next day <hi>Don Pantaleon,</hi> who did not appear at the appointed place, being prevented by his Brother the Ambaſſador, who had got notice of the Quarrel.

And he was indeed as good as his Word; for he appear'd there with an old Officer, and near ſix ſcore other perſons, ſome of which were provided with hand Granado's, to ſerve them in caſe of extremity. They had alſo placed Eight Men at each door of the Exchange, who were to take care, That if Colonel <hi>Gerard</hi> ſhould come with a greater number of Men than they had with them, they ſhould ſhut the Gates upon them.

                  <hi>Comwel</hi> had no ſooner notice given him of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and that he was not at his Brother's Houſe, but he put out a Proclamation for the apprehending of <hi>Don Pantaleon,</hi> promiſing a conſiderable Reward to ſuch as ſhould diſcover him. This had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd effect; for this Strumpet being inticed by the hopes of the Reward, deliver'd him up immediately after; when he was committed to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> demanded <hi>Don Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi> to be deliver'd into his Hands, as being joined in Commiſſion with his Brother the Ambaſſadour; But <hi>Cromwel</hi> perſiſted in his Reſolution, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Remonſtrances made to him on his behalf.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, Colonel <hi>Gerard</hi> being accus'd of having been engag'd in a Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> to favour the Deſigns of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. was alſo taken and committed to the Tower, where <hi>Pantaleon</hi> was before him; they were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Death at the ſame time, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had both their Heads cut off upon the ſame Scaffold.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> improv'd this Juncture to his advantage, to rid his Hands of Monſieur <hi>de Baſs,</hi> knowing him to be ſuſpected by the Protector, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concern'd in the ſame Plot with Colonel <hi>Gerard.</hi> For which reaſon the Protector ſent to the Cardinal, that he had given ſuch cauſe of ſuſpicion, as that he could not ſuffer him any longer near his Perſon; and the Cardinal judging it not convenient at that time to fall out with the Protector, had him recall'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p>I uſed about that time to viſit the Daughters of the Earl of <hi>Clare,</hi> who were ſo obliging as to invite me to go with them into the Country, to a Houſe of a Lady of Quality's, their Relation, where an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident befell us which had almoſt coſt us all our Lives: For a ſudden Fire happening to break out in the Houſe where we were, we had much a do to ſave our ſelves from being buried in the Ruins of the Houſe, which was juſt ready to fall as we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65930:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came away; it being an old Houſe, which in a little time was all burnt to the ground. Whilſt the Fire laſted, the young Ladies were very ſollicitous to comfort the Lady of the Houſe for her loſs, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd as little concern'd at it, as if ſhe had not had the leaſt ſhare in it; for ſhe return'd them the ſame Anſwer that was made by <hi>Job</hi> to his Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>God has Given it, God has taken it.</hi> And this her reſignation to God's Pleaſure, did not remain long unrewarded: For, as they were buſie in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Rubbiſh, and rebuilding the Foundations of a new Houſe, a conſiderable Treaſure was found; ſuppoſed to be buried there in the times of the Civil Wars, betwixt the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> by which ſhe was doubly repaid for the loſs of her Houſe.</p>
               <p>After our Return to <hi>London,</hi> I us'd frequently to viſit the young Ladies of <hi>Clare,</hi> they being the beſt humour'd Women in the World, where there was alſo a great reſort of the beſt Company in Town. Among the reſt, there was a certain young Lady of Quality, extreamly fair and well ſhap'd, who coming to viſit them one time, I fell extreamly in Love with; and the young Ladies of <hi>Clare,</hi> who were more her Friends than mine, having ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it, did all they could to encreaſe my Paſſion, by telling me a thouſand things to her advantage, nay they did not ſtick to exceed the bounds of Truth in her behalf, for they perſwaded me ſhe was very Rich, when in effect ſhe was not ſo.</p>
               <p>There being rather more freedom allow'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies than in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, I did not ſtick to make Love to her that very Day, and conducted her home, where I ſtay'd with, her for above an Hour. She was under the Tuition of one of her Aunts, who was lately come out Country, where ſhe liv'd with the Father of this young Lady, to take a little Diverſion in Town. I asked leave of her Aunt (as I had done of the young Lady before) to come and pay her a Viſit now and then, whilſt they ſtay'd in Town, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65930:17"/>
was eaſily granted, knowing me to be a near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours. Some of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions having ſoon diſcover'd that I us'd to make frequent Viſits there; and being curious to know the reaſon, as ſoon as they got ſight of the Lady, which was one of the handſomeſt in all <hi>England,</hi> were not long before they gueſs'd at the true cauſe of it. They could not forbear to talk of it to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> and by the deſcriptions they had given him of her Beauty, had made him as amorous as my ſelf, though he had cunning enough to diſſemble it, pretending that what reſpect he shew'd, was only upon my account. He would often tell me, that a Man muſt take Opportunity by the Foretop, that this was the time to make me for ever; that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was, I ſhould feaſt my Miſtriſs bravely, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cuſtom among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo to do; that he would be ready to aſſiſt me in puſhing it forward, and that his Purſe ſhould be at my Service. I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted his offers, and meeting with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſome days after, I invited both the Aunt and the Neice to an Entertainment, which they accepted of without much difficulty, it being the Cuſtom of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies, not to be too difficult in ſuch a caſe as this. I waited on them at the appointed time, in one of the Ambaſſadour's Coaches and carried them to a Houſe at ſome ſmall diſtance from the Town, in the Road to <hi>Hide</hi> Park; where a good Dinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got ready for us by his Excellencies Cooks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we were very merry together. About five or ſix a Clock towards Evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ambaſſadour, who had recommended this Houſe to me, which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made uſe of upon the like occaſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſs'd, as it were accidentally by in his Coach, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed among us, that he ſhould call upon me there, as he was coming back from <hi>Hide</hi> Park. To be ſhort, he acted the Innocent ſo naturally, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtop'd his Coach, under pretence to ask, whether they had not ſeen one of his Coaches paſs by that way; I look'd out of the Window, under pretence to ſee who it was that ask'd after his Coach; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65930:18"/>
having told them with ſome ſort of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, that the Ambaſſadour was there, they ſhew'd not the leaſt averſion to his comming up Stairs, as believing it to be a meer accident. He ſet himſelf at the Table next to my Miſtriſs, and fell moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately in Love with her. After ſome indifferent Diſcourſes, he made his application to her Aunt, deſiring leave to come and viſit her; which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, becauſe a Perſon of his Character could not be admitted to Viſit her, without giving occaſion of ſiniſter Interpretations to the World; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he perſiſted in his Entreaties, but to no purpoſe. However he ſtay'd with us till 10 a Clock at night, being become ſo amorous at the firſt ſight of her, that he had not the power to ſtir. But part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time being come at laſt, he was forc'd to leave them to my conduct. I continued to viſit this young Lady for three Months together, my Love encreaſing from day to day, and her Aunt gave us all the Liberty imaginable, I having declared to her that I intended to Marry her Neice: As the young Lady encourag'd my Paſſion, ſo in a little while after I was ſo far overcome with her Beauty, that I propoſed to Marry her privately, which ſhe readily conſented to, without conſidering that I was under Age. The main buſineſs was where to find a Prieſt who would venture to couple us together; and not knowing where to find a better, I perſwaded the Ambaſſadour's Cook, for once to ſerve for a Prieſt. Accordingly I pot him in a Prieſts Habit; and my Miſtriſs being a Proteſtant, and conſequently igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Ceremonies of our Church, could not judge whether he did his Office well or not. When I reflect at this time upon the heinouſneſs of the Fault I then committed, I am convinc'd that I ought not to grumble at my preſent Sufferings; being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that this Crime alone (if I had committed no others in all my Life) deſerves the moſt ſevere puniſhment that can be imagin'd.</p>
               <p>Thus impoſing upon this Lady, I indeed impos'd upon my ſelf. We lived afterwards together like
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65930:18"/>
Man and Wife, which being ſoon perceiv'd by her Aunt, ſhe acquainted her Relations with it. Theſe being reſolv'd to ſee us effectually Married, two of her Brothers, with two more of her Kinſmen came one morning to invite me to Dinner: I who did not ſuſpect their deſign, accepted of it without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, and ſo they carry'd me to the Houſe of a Juſtice of Peace (which in <hi>France</hi> is call'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary) the Aunt and Neice being there preſent as Gueſts invited to the Feaſt; the Juſtice of Peace, who was their Friend, after he had ſaluted us very civilly, told the eldeſt Brother of the Lady, that he would let them ſee his Houſe; ſo up Stairs they went, and my Wife taking me by the Hand follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. No ſooner were we come into the Cloſet of the Juſtice, but addreſſing himſelf to me, he told me that he wiſh'd me much Joy to ſo fair a Bride, and whether I would not make her my Wife? I, without gueſſing in the leaſt at his meaning, anſwer'd him, that I was not worthy to pretend to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; upon which he immediately ask'd her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe were willing to accept of me for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, unto which ſhe having anſwer'd Yes, he took his Pen and Ink, and did what further belonged to his Office. Then it was firſt, that my Eyes began to be open'd, being now convinc'd that I was catch'd in the Trap; and that I might not have the leaſt occaſion to doubt it, he made me ſign the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration I had made; which being likewiſe done by her, all her Relations preſent ſet their Names un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ours as Witneſſes, as I ſuppoſe, of what had been tranſacted. We were afterwards Entertain'd with a magnificent Dinner, where our Health was merrily drank about. From thence we return'd to her Aunt, where we were welcome again with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry handſom Supper; which being over, we were both conducted into a Chamber, where there was a very good Bed, made ready for our Diverſion.</p>
               <p>The next day was ſpent likewiſe in Feaſting, and the third day after we went into the Country, to my Spouſe's Father's Houſe, about Ten Miles diſtant
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65930:19"/>
from <hi>London.</hi> I was preſented to him as his Son-in-Law, having Married his Daughter before a Juſtice of Peace, which gave me no further reaſon to doubt, but that we had been Married according to the Cuſtom of the Country. After I had ſpent three weeks there, I returned alone to <hi>London,</hi> and gave an account to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> of what had happen'd to me, with an intention to go again into the Country in two or three days, till ſuch time that my Father, who was expected ſuddenly from <hi>France,</hi> ſhould come to Town. In the mean while, I had engag'd Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> to uſe all his Intereſt with my Father, to give his approbation to the Marriage, which he promis'd me to do; but as he continu'd ſtill in his amorous deſigns upon this Fair One, ſo he perſwaded me rather to let her come to <hi>London,</hi> than to live with her in the Country. I told him that I could not live in <hi>London,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of a Houſe and Furniture; to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that as long as I had good Friends, I could not want theſe things, and immediately order'd his Steward to pay me 4000 Livers to furniſh me a Houſe, which he took for me hard by his own. He lent me likewiſe a Coach with ſix Horſes; to fetch my Spouſe to Town, which I did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and the next day after we were come to our new Houſe, his Excellency paid us a Viſit, and preſented her with a very fine Nightrail, of which I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion, it being the Cuſtom in <hi>England,</hi> for Perſons who make a conſiderable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the World, to ſhew their Magnificence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch like Occaſions. Thus he continu'd his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits for ſome time; but coming one day home from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> my Spouſe deſir'd me to tell the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, that he might diſcontinue his Viſits for the future, adding that ſhe needed not tell me the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which I might eaſily gueſs at without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. The Truth is, I ſoon underſtood her meaning, but did not think it proper for me to paſs this Complement upon him: I told her therefore, that it would look better for her Father to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65930:19"/>
this Task, under pretence, that a Perſon of his Quality could not make ſo frequent Viſits to a young Married Woman, without giving occaſion to the World to cenſure her behaviour; that this reaſon being ſo plauſible, Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> could not in the leaſt take it amiſs; whereas if it ſhould come from me, he would not take it in good part.</p>
               <p>Whilſt Matters ſtood thus, my Father return'd from <hi>France,</hi> and being advertis'd of his coming, and unwilling to let him find us together, I ſent her to her Father's Houſe, whilſt my own was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd, to underſtand from Monſieur <hi>de Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>'s own Mouth that I was Married, the more, becauſe he ſoon underſtood, that ſhe had but a very ſlender Portion. Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> did all he could to appeaſe his Anger; and having then alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy laid the deſign, he intended to put in execution hereafter, he told my Father, that he would adviſe him to have a meeting with his Daughter-in-Law's Father, that poſſibly a means might be found out to bring them to an Accommodation, and that he might be prevail'd upon to give her ſuch a Portion, as he had no reaſon to be diſſatisfy'd with. The Interview was appointed at the Aunts, where my Father told them in plain terms, that the Marriage was null, by reaſon of my Minority; and that if they would have the Marriage take effect, they muſt give a good Portion to my pretended Wife; that I being a Man of Fortune without an Eſtate, unleſs they could give ſuch a Portion, as was ſufficient to maintain us both, there was no likelihood of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting together. The Lady's Father anſwer'd, that he would not diſable himſelf before his Death; that his Daughter had about 1200 Pounds left her by a Grandfather, which if it would content them he was ready to pay it, if not, he muſt take care of himſelf.</p>
               <p>But this did not ſatisfie my Father, who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 40000 Livers. Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> willing to lay hold of this opportunity to oblige my Spouſe, ſent her word by a certain Woman, the Wife of an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65930:20"/>
Apoſtate, who us'd to manage his Love Intrigues, that ſhe ſhould not be concern'd at his Demands, that His Excellency was ready to make up the Summ, in hopes ſhe would not prove ungrateful to him. I ſoon got notice of what had been propos'd upon this account; and being now no longer in doubt concerning his good Intentions towards me, I was extreamly puzzled, in what manner I ſhould behave my ſelf towards him. The firſt thing I did was to fall foul upon the Meſſenger of Love; at which Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> being ſo much ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he advis'd my Father to take me with him back into <hi>France.</hi> For, ſaid he, as ſoon as his Father-in-Law perceives you are in earneſt to ſend him away, he will ſtretch hard to draw him back again; and he will ſcarce run the hazzard of ſeeing his Family diſhonour'd, for want of an additional Portion. My Father was ſo credulous as to follow his advice; and I had no ſooner abandon'd my poſt, but he took poſſeſſion of it; tho' it muſt be confeſs'd, that an unlucky accident which happen'd about that time in the Family, did contribute not a little towards the obtaining his end.</p>
               <p>My Wife had an elder Siſter, who had made a worſe bargain of it than ſhe, being Debauch'd by a Married Man; who meeting one day her eldeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was ſo much exaſperated at the ſight of him, that he kill'd him in the Street. He was taken and committed to Priſon; which Monſieur <hi>de Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> had no ſooner notice of, but he ſent word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand to her Father, that if he would make his applications to him, he would ſee to obtain his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Accordingly both the Father and Daughter came to ſue for his Favour, which he promis'd them; and having thereby got the opportunity of having ſeveral private meetings with my Spouſe, he at laſt got her to comply with his deſires. It was not long before they threw away their Masks, her Father not daring to oppoſe it, by reaſon he was forc'd to rely on him for his Sons pardon; which made them act ſo barefac'd, that the whole Town took notice of it,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65930:20"/>
eſpecially, when a young Daughter, begot betwixt them, diſcover'd the whole Intrigue to the World. Notwithſtanding all which, my pretty Spouſe had confidence enough to ply me with Letters almoſt every Poſt, but was very careful to conceal the matter from me. But ſo ſoon as I had notice given me of it, by ſome of my Acquaintance I left in that Country, I civilly deſir'd her not to trouble me any more for the future, becauſe I hated her as much now, as I did love her before.</p>
               <p>At my arrival in <hi>Paris,</hi> I muſt confeſs, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd with all the marks of kindneſs by the old Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> tho' in a little while after, he could not forbear to give me now and then a ſmart touch upon my late Marriage. Nay, once he told me very freely for my Comfort, that when one went about to Marry in ſuch a faſhion as I had done, one ought to ſuppoſe, to provide a Wife both for ones Friends and ones ſelf. On the other hand, my pretty Spouſe furniſh'd me with another Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Comfort; for being vex'd at the laſt Anſwer I had ſent her, ſhe took an opportunity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd upon me, by divulging a Secret I had truſted her with.</p>
               <p>You muſt know that I had often told her, that I was ſent into <hi>England</hi> for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had conceiv'd a Jealouſie againſt me, as if I was fallen in love with the young Madam <hi>de Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux:</hi> She had cunning enough to turn theſe words to my diſadvantage with the Ambaſſadour, unto whom ſhe inſinuated that ſhe had all the reaſon in the World to believe, that this ſuſpicion had not been altogether groundleſs, and that it would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely for his Intereſt, to take effectual care that I ſhould not be admitted for the future to ſee her. Purſuant to this advice, the Ambaſſadour writ to his Father, who had no ſooner receiv'd the Letter, but he told his Daughter-in-Law, that her Husband had order'd I ſhould pay her no more Viſits for the future. He told me not a word of it, but I found him more reſerv'd than ordinary, and from that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65930:21"/>
time on, ſought for all poſſible means to remove me from <hi>Paris,</hi> knowing that abſence is the moſt effectual remedy againſt Love. He often talk'd with me of it, taking for his pretence the War that was then begun, and ſoon after recommended me to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>de Genlis Pizy,</hi> who commanded a Regiment of Horſe, and took me along with him, being very willing to oblige Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> I ſerv'd as a Volunteer in the Campaign of 1655. I was at the Seige of <hi>Landrecy,</hi> at the Seige of St. <hi>Guilain</hi> and <hi>Conde,</hi> which were forc'd to ſurrender; but we were oblig'd to raiſe the Seige from before <hi>Capelle.</hi>

               <p>After my return out of the Campaign, I met ſtill with a more cold reception than before, from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> which made me take a reſolution to go into the Country. Not far from my Father's, there liv'd a certain Gentleman, whoſe Name was <hi>Bleſſerie.</hi> who having a good Pack of Hounds, we often us'd to go out together a Hare hunting. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Morning early to his Houſe, I went into his Lady's Chamber to expect his return from a Neighbouring Village. His Wife being ſtill in Bed, as I entred the Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Door, which had a Spring-Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k happen'd to clap cloſe behind me. It was not long before the Gentleman came home, who finding us thus lock'd up together, began to conceive a Jealouſie againſt me, which I could plainly read in his Countenance. He ask'd me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, whether I would go a Hunting with him, which we did, but with ſome reluctancy on my ſide, being perhaps as uneaſie all the while as himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was not ignorant, that Jealouſie prompts Men to all the Extravagancies in the World. After we were return'd from hunting, each to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective home, I reſolv'd to be more ſpering in my Viſits, in hopes thereby to cure him of his Jealouſie; tho' I can declare it that I never gave him any real occaſion, as having not the leaſt intention againſt his Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tho' I never took the opportunity to try her Virtue, I believe her to be a very Vertuous Woman, at leaſt, ſhe had the reputation as ſuch in the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65930:21"/>At laſt a certain Gentleman, a near Kinſman of mine, who had been ſmitten with her, willing to improve this opportunity to inſinuate himſelf into this Jealous Man's Favour, whiſper'd it in his Ears, as if he had gather'd ſomething more than ſhould be from my own Diſcourſe, encouraging him at the ſame time to revenge the Affront, and offering his Service, as an unfeign'd Teſtimony of his Affection towards him. The jealous Husband being inveigl'd by theſe Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, they challeng'd me to fight with them. And notwithſtanding the ſevere prohibition againſt Duels, they rather challeng'd me to an Engagement, than a ſingle Combat; for they ſent me word that I muſt look out for ſome of my Friends to be my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, there being three on their ſide reſolv'd to ſtand and fall by one another. I gave anſwer to thoſe who brought the Challenge, that I would not accept of the Challenge, but that if they attack'd me firſt they might look to it.</p>
               <p>The jealous Husband was ſo much exaſperated at this Anſwer, that purſuant to the advice of his evil Councellors, he took a reſolution to aſſaſſinate me. I was advertis'd of their deſign, which made me be always upon my guard, and when I went abroad a Hunting, I had at leaſt two Friends along with me. One day as I was riding thus along with them, I ſaw ſeveral Horſemen making up towards me, which made me tell them, that it was I they aim'd at. One of them ſeeing the unequality of our Number left me immediately, but the other ſeem'd as if he would ſtand by me, and follow'd me cloſely, towards an Encloſure, which I was endeavouring to get into before they could come up cloſe with me. Here it was we reſolv'd to ſtand the brunt; but thoſe who purſu'd me being come within Muſquet ſhot of us, cry'd out to him who was with me, that they had no Quarrel againſt him, that his beſt way would be to retire from thence, elſe they would ſpare him as little as me.</p>
               <p>There needed no more to make him leave me in the lurch, as the other had done before; and tho' I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65930:22"/>
did not know where to turn my ſelf in this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. yet I put on the beſt Countenance I could; when one of the Aſſaſſins fir'd at me, and wounded me in Hip, I fell immediately ſprawling upon the Ground, and they believing I was kill'd outright, rid away full ſpeed.</p>
               <p>In the mean while one of my Companions, he that left me firſt of all, had made the beſt of his way to a Neighbouring Town, where having given the Alarm, the Inhabitants who came to my aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, did carry me to my Father's Houſe, where I was ſix Months before I could be cured of my Wounds.</p>
               <p>There was ſcarce any body who believ'd I could eſcape with Life; and I being of the ſame opinion my ſelf, deſir'd my Father to recall my Siſter out of a Nunnery, where ſhe had been Eleven Years, without the leaſt hopes of being prevail'd upon to embrace the Religious Life, which my Father had often endeavour'd to perſwade her to, and was juſt then upon the point of having forc'd her to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of ſome Parents, who are not able to give Portions to their Daughters, or elſe will not part with their Money, for fear of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing the Family. You may imagine that this was joyful News for her, flattering herſelf, that by my Death ſhe ſhould forever be freed from what ſhe dreaded moſt.</p>
               <p>But contrary to the opinion of all, I was cured once more, tho' for a whole Year together I was ſo weak, as not to be able to mount on Horſeback, which was the reaſon that in two Campaigns I did not appear in the Field. I afterwards obtain'd a Commiſſion of a Cornet, in the Marqueſs <hi>de Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> Company, in the great Royal Regiment, for which I ſtood indebted to the Courteſie of Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux:</hi> Whilſt I was Employ'd in the Army, my Father proſecuted thoſe who attempted to Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate me, ſo vigorouſly, that being out-law'd they were forc'd to fly the Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65930:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>I told you before, that purſuant to a Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the laſt was to furniſh us with Six Thouſand Foot, and Thirty Men of War; Theſe were to be employ'd againſt <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> under condition, that the place, after it was taken, ſhould be ſurrender'd to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> So ſoon as the King had receiv'd Intelligence that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was put to Sea, and that theſe 6000 Men were join'd our Forces, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was beſieg'd in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> in the Year 1658. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> advanc'd with an Army to relieve the Place. The Marſhal <hi>de Hoquincourt,</hi> who had quitted the King's Party, came with a Body to view our Lines, and Engag'd our main Guard, where he was kill'd in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Monſieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> obſerving that the Enemy were reſolv'd to Attack us in our Lines, drew out his Forces to make Head againſt them. The Battle was fought with great obſtinacy for ſome time on both ſides; but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe beginning firſt to give way, were ſo warmly ply'd by ours, that they were forc'd to abandon the Foot. Four of their Regiments ſeeing themſelves enclos'd on all ſides, threw down their Arms without ſtriking a ſtroak, and cry'd out for Quarter. The reſt diſcourag'd by their Example, durſt not ſtand it out much longer; ſo that in the purſuit we kill'd a great number of them, and got abundance of Priſoners. In the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit I was wounded by a Muſquetoon: The Ball went into the left Cheek about an inch under the Eye, and paſs'd through the Head, coming out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain near the Ear on the ſame ſide. I was carried to Monſieur <hi>de Sangoin,</hi> Son-in-Law to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> who was then Maſter of the King's Houſhold, from whom I receiv'd very ſingular Marks of his Affection: Whilſt I lay under cure, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ſurrender'd to the King, and <hi>Turenne</hi> made ſome other Conqueſts in theſe parts. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing their Affairs to be in a declining condition, were willing to make Peace now, which they had refus'd before. So I was disbanded, and return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I found I had other Fiſh to fry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65930:23"/>You muſt know, that my Engliſh Spouſe had all this while continued her amorous Intrigues with Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux.</hi> But the face of Affairs was much changed of late in <hi>England;</hi> for after the Death of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> his Son <hi>Richard</hi> finding his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders too weak to bear the Burthen his Father had born with ſo much Reſolution; he was ſcarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the ſame Dignity, but he laid it down of his own accord, and reſign'd his place to the true Heir of the Crown, who was Acknowledged and Proclaimed by the People their King; Mounſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> had Orders ſent him to Compliment the King upon his Reſtauration to the Throne; but he refuſed to admit him into his preſence, as having born the Character of Ambaſſador under the Uſurpation of his mortal Enemy. Being therefore recall'd by the King he return'd to <hi>France,</hi> and was ſoon after followed by my Spouſe.</p>
               <p>He was no ſooner come to <hi>Paris,</hi> but he told my Father, that I muſt take my Wife again, her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents having been prevailed upon to allow her the deſired Summ for her Portion, and for fear they ſhould retract, he had made them to depoſite the Money in his Hands. My Father anſwer'd, that he believ'd I would not do it, and that if I were to ask him his Opinion, he would not adviſe me to it. This Anſwer was not very pleaſing to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> who told my Father, that whether I would, or not, it muſt be done; that he himſelf had given him his Word, that he would give his Conſent to the Match, provided ſhe had a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 40000 Livers paid down; That thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had Treated with them upon theſe Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that now his Honour lay at ſtake. My Father reply'd, That thoſe Reaſons would ſcarce be ſtrong enough to induce me to comply with what he deſired. Thus they parted, not without ſome hard Words on both ſides; nevertheleſs Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> deſired him to bring me to him the next day, that he might talk with me himſelf. But I refuſed to go, which made him alter his meaſures,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65930:23"/>
and engaged Monſieur <hi>Sangoin</hi> to invite me to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He knew that I had a great Deference for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Sangoin,</hi> and that I could not refuſe him, what I would have refuſed to any body elſe. He was there preſent at my coming, ſhewing not the leaſt concern, by which ſtratagem he hoped to ſurpriſe me the ſooner. I no ſooner ſaw him, but I readily gueſs'd that his aim was at me; and it was not long before they both began to engage with me, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning this buſineſs. They told me, that I did not conſider my own good Fortune: That I could ſcarce ever hope to meet with ſo fair and rich a Wife; and ſo much accompliſh'd as this. I told them, that perhaps this might be, but that if I could not meet with all theſe rare Qualifications, I would endeavour at leaſt to have one, that might be more vertuous; after they had told me many more ſuch like things, Monſieur <hi>de Sangoin</hi> taking me aſide, told me, That I was very unwiſe thus to inſiſt upon a fantaſtical notion; that it would be much more for my advantage to advance my Fortune than to be ſo opiniatre againſt my own Intereſt. He ſaid if it was more money I wanted, he would take care I ſhould have it, which would make me eaſie all at once. I gave him for an Anſwer, That it was not Money that could tempt me, and that whoever would take the pains to trouble me any further about it, would only loſe their labour.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Sangoin,</hi> having told my Anſwer to Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> he once more told me at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he ſaw plainly I had forgot what both his Father and he had done for me; That it would be beſt for me not to ſlight the Offer he had made me: That it was ſtill in their power to do me good Service, and that it would be better for me, to take is into ſerious conſideration, before it was too late. He ſent alſo for my Father, unto whom I had given an Account of what had paſt at this interview. He ask'd him, whether I had conſidered the matter and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had not altered my reſolution. My Father Anſwered him No, and I had conceived ſuch a hatred
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65930:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt this Creature, That the only way to put me in an ill humour, was to Name her; that ſince the laſt Interview I had neither Eat nor Drunk, and if I continued thus much longer, there would be more occaſion to conſult about my Burial, than a Marriage.</p>
               <p>At laſt Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> began to change his tune, and told my Father, That it I would not do what I ought to do by fair Means, he would find a way to make me do it: That he would not for the future acknowledge me for his Kinſman; and that he'd prove as ſevere an Enemy, as he had been a Friend to me: That he had ſome Intereſt in the Parliament, which he would make uſe of to bring me to reaſon, and to make me ſenſible who was in the Right, and who in the Wrong.</p>
               <p>Thus having Declared open War againſt me, he ſent me a Summons in the Name of my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spouſe, to ſhew cauſe why the ſaid Marriage ſhould not ſtand good, and accordingly to pay her a Yearly Penſion of 2000 Livers <hi>per Annum.</hi> for her Subſiſtance, till the matter ſhould be decided by Law; for which my Father ſhould ſtand engaged, as well as my ſelf; to ſuch a point of Extravagancy this Man was hurried on by his boundleſs Paſſion. To confeſs the Truth I did not very well like the matter, not knowing what to think of it, if God had not interpoſed betwixt us; for my Father had but few Friends in Compariſon of Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> and this would not have been the firſt caſe, where Intereſt has prevail'd above Juſtice.</p>
               <p>It happened that at the Publick entry of the Queen, which was made in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1660. There was a Throne Erected for the Queen to Mount upon, without <hi>St. Anthony</hi>'s Gate; Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who was at that time no more than Secretary to the Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> plac'd himſelf behind the Chair of State of her Majeſty; Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> who was Chancellor to the Queen told him, That the place belonged to him. But Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> who rely'd upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65930:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Cardinal, refuſing to give him the place, ſome hard Words paſſed betwixt them. Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> made his Complaints to the Cardinal, who juſtify'd Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi> in what he had done; Monſieur <hi>de Bordeaux</hi> being naturally of a very haughty temper, took the thing ſo much to heart, that he return'd home and took his Bed, where he dy'd in two days after.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſaw my ſelf freed from a potent Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but that unfortunate Woman, whom he had taken into his protection againſt all Juſtice and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was thereby reduc'd to a more deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than can be expreſs'd. For you muſt know, that ſhe had truſted him with all her Portion, of which ſhe never ſaw a Groat again. Not, but that in his laſt Will, he acknowledg'd to have receiv'd the ſaid Summ, and beſides this left her a Legacy of 24000 Livers. But his Executors did manage the matter ſo, that there appear'd to be more Debts, than means to ſatisfie them withal, which was a juſt puniſhment from God for her Miſcarriages. She had beſides this, the misfortune to loſe her cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, the Marriage was declar'd void, and as I have underſtood ſince, was reduc'd to a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition; a remarkable Inſtance, that thoſe who leave the path of Virtue, meet commonly with condign puniſhment for their Crimes in this World.</p>
               <p>I continu'd for ſome time longer in <hi>Paris,</hi> though I was not very eaſie there; for I committed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Miſdemeanour, for which I muſt give a ſevere account to God, tho' the thing was not premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, but happen'd accidentally. I us'd often to converſe with a young Gentleman, whoſe Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Attorney, had taken a reſolution to quit his Employment, and to live at his eaſe in the Country.</p>
               <p>He had juſt left the Inns of Court, with his Son and Clerk, in order to retire into the Country, when I met them upon the Road in a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly poſture, which ſoon might be diſcover'd in my Countenance, having neither Money, nor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65930:25"/>
knowing were to get any: The Attorney ask'd me what was the matter with me, and why I appear'd ſo melancholy? I told him, without making the leaſt reflection upon what I was going to ſay, that I was about looking for a Chapman, for a good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice that was in my diſpoſal. He ask'd me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately what Benefice it was, and told me, that he himſelf had for a good while been looking out for ſuch a thing, and if it did fit him, he was as likely as any body to deal with me for it, and that I might as well diſpoſe of it to him as to another. He thereupon gave me his Hand, as a token of his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; and his Son, who obſerv'd what pains his Father took to enſnare himſelf, tipp'd the wink up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, to give me to underſtand that I ſhould go on with the Intrigue. Then we began to come to the particulars. I told him that this Benefice was a Priory of 1500 Livers yearly Revenue, of which I had the Preſentation, as being Heir to one of my Unkles, whoſe it had been before; that it was Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in <hi>Normandy,</hi> in one of the faireſt parts of the Country. This made the old Fellow's Mouth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He would needs have me Dine with him, and we did let the Glaſs go briskly round to the Health of the Benefice, with which he was already more in Love, than ever he had been with any of his Miſtriſſes. He thought it therefore high time to come to the main point, and told me, that if we could agree about the price, he would ſend his Clerk to take a view of it.</p>
               <p>His Clerk was as errand a Rakehell as the Son, and they both once more tipp'd the wink upon me, to ſtrike up the Bargain: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolv'd to ſell him a Pennyworth, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed for 200 <hi>Lowis d'or's,</hi> and he immediately ſent his Clerk to make an exact Inquiry into the matter. The Clerk made him believe as if he was going his Journey, but never ſtirr'd out the Town, where in the mean while we ſpent the Money he had allow'd him for his Expences. When he thought it time to appear again, he told the Attorney, that indeed he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65930:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had not been ſo far as the place where the Priory was, having by good chance met with the Perſon who Farm'd the Revenues of it, that they had Supp'd and Lodg'd in the ſame Inn, by whom he had been inform'd concerning every particular, which he found agreeable to what he had heard me declare before; which had made him think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to go farther, knowing that he would be eager to know the truth of the matter, to conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Bargain.</p>
               <p>The Attorney being overjoy'd at this welcom News, ſent immediately for a Barber to be ſhav'd, reſign'd his Chambers and Buſineſs to his Son, and ſhew'd me the draught of the Aſſignment I was to make to him; which being done, he paid me down the 200 <hi>Lewis d'ors,</hi> as a conſideration for the Purchaſe. His Son, the Clerk and I liv'd very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily together upon the old Fellow's Money, till moſt part of it was ſpent; but as ſoon as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood he had made all the neceſſary preparations to take poſſeſſion of his Priory, I thought it high time to get away into the Country. I believe the old Spark look'd very blank, when he found that he had purchas'd what was no where to be ſeen. How his Son and Clerk did come off with him, I am not able to tell, having never heard a word men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd of it ſince; becauſe ſome weighty Reaſons oblig'd me ſoon after to leave <hi>France,</hi> which I did not ſee again for many Years after.</p>

               <p>THE firſt Welcome I met with in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was, that my Father, who by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of my Siſter, was extreamly exaſperated againſt me, turn'd me out of Doors. I did whatever I could to appeaſe his Anger, but finding all means ineffectual, I had recourſe to a Kinſman of ours, whoſe Name was <hi>Courtilloles,</hi> whom I deſir'd to interceed for me. He
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65930:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a Gentleman of near 1000 Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> which as it makes a Man very acceptable to his Friends in theſe days, ſo my Father, as well upon that Score, as for his other good Qualifications ſake, had a particular reſpect for him. But whatever Perſwaſions and Interceſſions he could make uſe of in my behalf, my Father was ſo prepoſſeſs'd by my Siſter, that he would ſcarce ſuffer to hear it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in his preſence, for me to come and ſee him. But Monſieur <hi>Courtilloles</hi> receiv'd me very kindly into his Houſe, and his good Company allay'd in ſome meaſure the trouble I was in for my Father's unkindneſs.</p>
               <p>But that which was my greateſt comfort of all was, that it was not long, before I fell in Love with Monſieur <hi>de Courtilloles</hi> Lady's Woman. She was ſomewhat related to them, which made her much more reſpected by them, than your Fanflaps generally us'd to be. But this was the leaſt of my conſideration; ſhe was a very handſom and well deſerving Perſon, and very Vertuous, tho' this laſt Qualification pleas'd me the leaſt of all at firſt: For as I had hitherto met but with very few that were ſo, ſo I thought her to be like the greateſt part of her Sex; but finding my ſelf deceiv'd in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I both lov'd and eſteem'd her the more. She told me, that if I expected any returns of Love from her, the only means to obtain them would be to Marry: But I was not ſo much beyond my ſelf, as not to conſider, that one with nothing would not ſerve my turn. I was not ſo ill bred as to tell her ſo poſitively; but being reſolv'd to break off with her, I laid hold of this pretext, that my Eſtate was not ſufficient to maintain a Wife withal. Her Anſwer was, that my Love was not ſo hot as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſince I could ſo well conſider of the matter. This touch'd me to the quick, and nothing in the World is more frail than a Lover, I was enſnar'd deeper than ever.</p>
               <p>But there happen'd ſomething which had almoſt ſet me at Liberty, when I leaſt expected it. A Curate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65930:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a Neighbouring Pariſh belonging to Monſieur <hi>de Courtilloles</hi> his Lordſhip, had a Brother a Widower, who had ſcrap'd together an Eſtate of about 150 Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> and was deſperately in Love with this young Gentlewoman, whoſe Name was <hi>Launay.</hi> This being look'd upon as an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Match for one that had nothing, the Curate had no ſooner ſpoke of it to Madam <hi>de Curtilloles,</hi> but ſhe told him, that his Brother might be aſſur'd he ſhould meet with a good Reception. And believing that the Gentlewoman, who otherwiſe had cunning enough, would not refuſe ſo advantageous an offer, ſhe told her what anſwer ſhe had given to the Curate, unto which ſhe careleſly reply'd, that ſhe would not Marry a Scoundrel, if he had a Thouſand Pounds a Year.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Curtilloles</hi> did what ſhe could to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her that ſhe was in the wrong to ſlight him, there being nothing more comfortable than a good Eſtate; and that a Gentlewoman without a Portion, was in a worſe condition than one of a meaner Rank; but all theſe Conſiderations made ſo little Impreſſion upon Mrs <hi>Launay,</hi> that ſhe would not ſo much as ſee her Suitor, tho' he was come a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miles, on purpoſe to declare his Love to her. Madam <hi>de Curtilloles</hi> addreſs'd her ſelf to me, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, that ſhe believ'd her Woman to have ſome deference for me, and that if I could perſwade her to accept of the Match, ſhe would look upon it as a particular Obligation. But ſhe happen'd to chuſe the worſt Match-maker ſhe could have pitch'd upon in this caſe; for as her denial had rais'd my Love to the higheſt pitch, I was ſo far from perſwading her to follow her Miſtriſſes Counſel, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I told her, that ſhe could oblige me no better than to leave the Houſe, if they perſiſted to force this Match upon her; which ſhe promis'd me to do, and was as good as her word. For, perceiving that her Miſtriſs had ſmelt the Rat, concerning our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and upon that ſcore was more urgent with her than before; ſhe went to an Unkle's Houſe of hers,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65930:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Mothers ſide, who was Curate of a Town, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven or eight Leagues diſtant from thence. I follow'd her immediately, and being now in love over Head and Ears, I married her with the conſent of her Unkle; whom, for fear he ſhould make any oppoſition, I had put upon by forg'd Certificates concerning my Age; and thus we ſoon met with a Neighbouring Curate, who without much examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter, coupl'd us together. This being over, it was the advice of her Uncle, that I ſhould abſent my ſelf for a little while, to ſee how my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would digeſt the matter. Accordingly I went to a Relation of mine, by my Mothers ſide, whoſe Name was <hi>Savonnieres.</hi> He was a Man of Pleaſure, which made me paſs my time very merrily there, moſt of our time being ſpent, in viſiting ſome times one, ſometimes another Perſon of Quality. One time as we paid a Viſit to the Marquiſs <hi>du Bellai</hi> at <hi>Giſeux,</hi> we found him much out of Humour, by reaſon of a difference betwixt the Duke <hi>de Briſſac</hi> and him, near whom he had a very fine Seat, call'd <hi>Thouarſai.</hi> The Quarrel firſt ariſe about the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Hunting, and the Duke <hi>de Briſſac</hi> had us'd ſome of his Game-keepers very ſcurvily. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Marquiſs deſir'd <hi>Savonnieres,</hi> who was his Couſin German, to go and carry a Challenge from him to the Duke <hi>de Briſſac.</hi> But <hi>Savonnieres</hi> told him, that he knowing him to be his near Kinſman, he would certainly avoid ſeeing him; and that therefore it would do much better if I, who was not in the leaſt known to him, did undertake the thing.</p>
               <p>The Marquiſs being well ſatisfied with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we all three together mounted our Horſes, and ſo to his Seat of <hi>Thouarſai</hi> we went, from whence I was ſent the next morning to the Duke of <hi>Briſſac.</hi> As ſoon as I ſaw him, I told him that being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of this Country, I was come to pay my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to him; upon which he bid me Wellcome; and it was not long before I had the opportunity to ſpeak to him alone, and to tell him, that in effect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65930:28"/>
I was not come to him upon a Compliment, but that the Marquiſs <hi>de Bellai,</hi> expected to meet him with Sword in hand; That he had one Gentleman more beſides my ſelf with him, who were to be his Seconds, and that therefore he might appear there with the like number. The Duke <hi>de Briſſec</hi> ask'd me if I knew who he was, and how I durſt talk to him at that rate. I told him that I was not Ignorant that he was a Duke and Peer of <hi>France;</hi> but that at the ſame time it was my opinion, that his Quality could not exempt him from giving ſatisfaction to a Gentleman of that Quality, as he was, unto whom the Injury was done by him. I told him further, that the Princes of the Blood, whoſe Quality was Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to his, did not think it below themſelves to give ſatisfaction upon ſuch like occaſions, and that I ſuppoſed, he needed not be aſhamed to follow their example. He was extreamly angry at theſe Words, and whether he really thought he was in the right, or whether for want of Courage he began to talk ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry big, and told me, that if he ſhould Treat me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Deſerts, he would have me thrown out of the Windows; but that he would Pardon me for this time in reſpect of my Youth. He ſpoke theſe Words very loud, ſo that perceiving his Servants to come about him, I thought beſt to get on Horſe-back again, which I did, and gave the Marquiſs <hi>de Bellai</hi> an account of the ill ſucceſs of my Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Marquiſs being Vehemently Exaſperated at the ſlighting anſwer of the Duke, did vent part of his Anger upon two of his Game-keepers, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately met him in a little while after; for they were ſoundly Baſtinado'd by us, and to give them to underſtand, that it was not done but premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately, we told them that they ſhould be ſure to tell their Maſter, who they were, that had hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them thus. The Duke made his Complaints to the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> ſuppoſing to receive a more Ample ſatisfaction from their hands; than if he had Summoned us in any of the Inferior Courts. The Marquiſs <hi>de Bellai</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Savonnieres</hi> were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65930:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
accordingly Summon'd up to <hi>Paris,</hi> to anſwer the Complaint made againſt them, and ſtrict Orders were ſent to both Parties to abſtain from all manner of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the mean while. I for my part eſcaped without any further trouble, as being unknown both to the Duke and the Game-keepers. But before the Term appointed in the Summons was expired, Monſieur <hi>Savonnieres,</hi> return'd to <hi>Angiers,</hi> near which place he dwelleth. There lived at that time a Gentleman of the Family of <hi>Beautru,</hi> of Five Hundred Pounds a Year in that City, who having but one only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Savonnieres,</hi> who did not know that I had entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my ſelf before, did propoſe me as a fit match for her; and the better to compaſs his purpoſe, he told her Father many Advantageous things both of my Eſtate and Perſon: But ſome People having told the Gentleman that my Fathers Eſtate was in no wiſe anſwerable to what Monſieur <hi>Savonineres</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it was, this match came to nothing; tho' ſoon after his Daughter made a very bad bargain of it; for both he and ſhe were catch'd in the Trap by a Stranger, who managed his matters ſo dexterouſly, that I cannot forbear to give a ſhort account of it here.</p>
               <p>This unknown perſon who went under the name of the Baron <hi>de Caſenavre</hi> made a great Figure at <hi>Angiers,</hi> keeping three Servants, a <hi>Valet du Chambre,</hi> and two Footmen. He was Originally from <hi>Bearn,</hi> and as they are at <hi>Angiers</hi> well uſed to ſtrangers, (it being an Univerſity) ſo no body was over curious to enquire either into his Extraction or Eſtate; ſuppoſing either of them to be ſuitable to his way of Living, which gave him the opportunity to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Ladies Company whom he uſed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Viſit, and among the reſt the Daughter of Monſieur <hi>de Beautru,</hi> upon whom he had a deſign, as being the Richeſt of them all. He was a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom young Fellow, ſo that the young Lady ſhew'd ſo much Inclination for him, that he ſoon gained his end. To be ſhort, ſhe prov'd with Child, and when he thought himſelf ſure of it, he went to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65930:29"/>
Provoſt-Marſhal of the City, whom he had made his Friend on purpoſe to ſerve him upon occaſion; and told him, that being forc'd to depart immediately he thought he ſhould have committed a groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, if he had not firſt bid him farewel, and given him thanks for the many Courteſies he had receiv'd from him.</p>
               <p>The Provoſt wondering what could make him take ſo ſudden a Reſolution, ask'd him, What could be the meaning of it, ſince he had not mention'd the leaſt thing of it the day before when he ſaw him; and how was it poſſible for him to part ſo ſuddenly with his Miſtreſs, for whom he had hitherto ſhew'd ſo much Paſſion? The Baron deſir'd him, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon that Subject, becauſe he could not ſay what he ought of it. This having rais'd a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Curioſity in the Provoſt, he urged the matter ſo home to the Baron, that he judging it now to be the nick of time to ſpeak, he told him, that if he would promiſe him ſecreſie, he would diſcloſe the whole matter to him. The Provoſt having engag'd his Word, the Baron told him, that the reaſon of his leaving <hi>Angiers</hi> was, becauſe he had lov'd the Perſon, they ſpoke of, too much; that he lov'd her as much as ever he did, and that he was ſure he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe to love her whilſt he liv'd: But that he had a Mother alive, without whoſe conſent he durſt not Marry: That ſhe was likewiſe bent to Match him with a Lady of Quality, and that therefore he was ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affraid ſhe would never conſent he ſhould Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this young Lady; That ſhe being big with Child he ſaw himſelf under a neceſſity to depart without taking his leave from any body for fear of worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences: That his Reſolution was, if by any means poſſible he could obtain his Mothers conſent to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her, he did proteſt to him upon his Honour, he would return immediately, he being not of the ſame opinion with his Mother, but that a young Lady of indifferent Quality, whom he lov'd was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before one he did not love, tho' of the higheſt Rank.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65930:29"/>After ſome little time, which was ſpent in ſuch like diſcourſes, having taken his farewel, the Provoſt got himſelf dreſs'd immediately, and away he went to the young Lady's Fathers Houſe, whom he found aſleep; but being awakened, he gave him the whole recital of the Matter. The Father much ſurpriz'd, deſir'd the Provoſt to keep his Emiſſaries ready to mount on Horſe-back; however, before they ſent them abroad, they thought it moſt adviſable to make a ſtrict enquiry, whether his Daughter was really with Child; for, ſays he, without that, I ſhould not be ſo forward to Marry my Daughter to a Stranger, but rather near home. Thus they went into the young Ladies Chamber, whom they rouz'd out of her ſleep, and the Provoſt, by the Father's Order, told her, that the Baron <hi>de Caſenavre</hi> was return'd all on a ſudden to his own Country, without an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come any more to <hi>Angiers;</hi> That if therefore ſhe was ſenſible that ſomething more than ordinary had paſs'd betwixt them, ſhe would do well to let her Father know before it was too late.</p>
               <p>There needed no more to make the poor Lady to confeſs the whole Truth, ſhe burſt out immediately into Tears, and throwing her ſelf at her Father's Feet, ſhe Conjur'd him to forgive her this Fault, into which ſhe was drawn by her Credulity; that the Baron had promis'd to Marry her, and that if it were true that he would never return, ſhe had no other way left her but to retire into a <hi>Nunnery.</hi> This was the Signal for the Provoſt to purſue the Baron, who being overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at about Two Leagues, from the Town, ſeem'd as if he were extreamly ſurpriz'd to ſee him come after him, with his Men at his Heels. He clap'd his hands to his Piſtols, upbraiding the Provoſt with Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in divulging his Secret, but being ſurrounded and ſeized, he told them, that he hoped to meet him one time or another, when he had not ten to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and that he would endeavour to be even with him. Thus they return'd to the City, and ſcarce had they been a quarter of an hour at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt's Houſe, but his Miſtreſſes Father appear'd, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65930:30"/>
ask'd the Baron, whether he would deal handſomly with his Daughter, or elſe they muſt find a way to make him; That there was but two ways, either to go to Priſon or elſe to Marry his Daughter. The Baron who was reſolv'd to act his Part to the utmoſt in this Comedy, anſwer'd, That he lov'd his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that degree, as to wiſh for nothing ſo much as to make her his Spouſe, and that he would engage his Honour never to marry any other but her; but that the only thing he deſir'd was, to ſend one along with him to procure the Conſent of his Mother, or that at leaſt they would delay the matter ſo long, till he could Write to, and have an Anſwer from her.</p>
               <p>The young Ladies Father, who was afraid that this delay might prove dangerous to his Daughter's Honour, if the thing ſhould take vent, told him he could conſent to neither, that when the thing was done he did not queſtion his Mother's approbation, becauſe his Daughter was likely to be Heireſs to at leaſt ten Thouſand Pounds, and that ſuch Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were but ſeldom to be met with at <hi>Bern.</hi> The Baron who deſired no more than this, having at laſt given his conſent, the Marriage was conſummated immediately to the ſatisfaction of both Parties. But the Baron having both before and ſince his Marriage made great brags of his Eſtate, his Father-in-law was mighty deſirous to go with him into his own Country; ſo that he was once more forced to put all the wit he had to work to diſſwade him from that Journey: He told him therefore, that it would not do well for them both to leave his Wife alone, who perhaps might be brought to bed in the mean while; and that it would be the much better way, to ſend his Brother along with him to <hi>Bearn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Brother, you muſt know, was a good Fellow, who loved his Cup better than his Buſineſs, he being a Counſellor at <hi>Angiers.</hi> The Baron's Father-in-law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevail'd upon to let his Brother go with his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, they both ſet forward together, and liv'd very, merrily upon the Road. A little after their Arrival at <hi>Bern,</hi> (which was about a League diſtant from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65930:30"/>
Seat of the Baron) there came two Gentlemen who bid them welcome to Town, and ſhew'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Reſpect to the Baron. From thence they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him and the Counſellor to a very handſom Seat, which paſſed for his own, where there was an Ancient Matron to receive them, who embrac'd him as her Son, and all the Servants paid him the ſame Reſpect as their young Maſter. The Table-Cloath being laid, they made good Chear, and the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour got ſo Drunk, that they were forced to lay him in Bed. In the mean while the Baron had leiſure given him to inſtruct them more fully in every thing he had writ to them before. He told them that he had Married a young Lady of a great Fortune; that the Perſon whom they had ſeen was her Uncle, who was come on purpoſe to take an Account of his Family and Eſtate; That it would be no difficult matter for them to make him believe what they pleas'd, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they ply'd him well with Wine, he would not trouble himſelf much further; That the only thing they had to manage was, that whenever he ſhould talk to his pretended Mother, concerning his late Marriage, ſhe muſt ſeem very averſe to it, till by the Interceſſion of a Friend of his ſhe ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon to give her approbation after ſome time.</p>
               <p>Matters being thus concerted betwixt them, they found out a Cunning Fellow, who ſhould wait on the Counſellor at his Levy, as if he came to pay him a Viſit as a Stranger. This Spark Acted his part ſo well, that as ſoon as the Counſellor happen'd but to mention the Baron's Name, he began to extol him to the Sky, but above all things ſpoke Wonders of his vaſt Eſtate, ſo that the Unkle, who was pretty hot headed as yet, was wonderfully proud of his Nephew. At that very moment the Baron enter'd the Counſellor's Chamber, where to Breakfaſt they went, and drinking good large Bumpers, they ſet the Counſellor in again for that day. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd the ſame Courſe for three Weeks together, whilſt they ſtay'd in the Houſe; ſo that the Unkle had no opportunity to ſpeak to any body, but who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65930:31"/>
was taught his Leſſon before. The concluſion of the Play was, that the Baron ſpeaking to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning his late Match, ſhe acted her part ſo dexterouſly, that this ſerv'd as the chiefeſt confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the Counſellor, of the opinion he had conceiv'd before, of his Nephew's Quality and Eſtate. For to compleat the whole, ſhe told him, that ſince he had been pleas'd to marry himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her conſent, ſhe could not prevent what was done; but that to make him ſenſible of his Error, ſhe was reſolv'd to give him nothing till after her Death, which ſhe ſhould never have thought on, if he had ask'd her conſent before his Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Baron appear'd much afflicted at it, and could not forbear to utter his Complaints to his Unkle, who was fain to comfort him; telling him, that his Mother being very Antient, he needed not fear, but that he would e're long be Maſter of the whole Eſtate. They left <hi>Bearn</hi> a few days after, the Baron pretending it was impoſſible for him to ſtay longer from his Spouſe: When they return'd to <hi>Angiers,</hi> they were joyfully receiv'd by the whole Family, who had already had an Account of every thing by the Counſellor's Letters; which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confirm'd to them by word of Mouth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the whole to be nothing but truth. The whole City and Adjacent Country rung of the great Match of Monſieur <hi>de Beautru</hi>'s Daughter. Her Father dy'd ſoon after, and ſome ſaid it was for Joy. But as things will come out one time or other, it was at laſt diſcover'd; that this Baron was only a younger Brother, who had no other Fortune but his Sword, and that his Eſtate and Riches were only in imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Unkle was jecr'd wherever he came, to have been thus impos'd upon; but he did not much matter their Words, as long as he had his full ſhare of good Wine. This may ſerve as an Inſtance that Marriages with Strangers are to be avoided, there being ſcarce one in a hundred that ſucceeds well. Not but that the Baron was a very honeſt Gentleman as to his Perſon, but as for his Eſtate he had nothing to brag of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65930:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>Monſieur <hi>Savonnieres</hi> being by this time to make his appearance before the Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> I was fain to look out for freſh Quarters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Father would not be reconcil'd to me as yet. I met with very good ones, at a Gentleman's Houſe near <hi>Chateaugontier;</hi> and being gone abroad one day a hunting with two of his Sons, the eldeſt of which was much of my Age, we ſaw at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a Meſſenger in a Foreſt, conducting two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to <hi>Paris,</hi> one of whom was a young Man of about two and twenty, the other a young Woman of about eighteen Years of Age. We made all the haſte we could to come up with them, to ſee them, and to know their Crime. We ask'd the young Woman, who was very genteel, what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with her and the young Man? She anſwer'd us with tears in her Eyes, that he was her Brother, that they were both condemn'd to Death, and that they had deſerv'd it. They would give us no further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but one of the Provoſt's Men told us, that they had lain together, which was the occaſion of their preſent Calamity. We pity'd them extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and having taken a reſolution to ſave them, we told the Provoſt's Men, that if they did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately take off their Fetters and Chains, we would treat them very ſcurvily, and told them that we were ſtrong enough, becauſe we had at ſome little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, three Servants more with two Fuzee's. But they looking upon this only as a Rhodomontado, told us, that if we did meddle with them, it would be to our coſt, which we matter'd but little; and cocking our Piſtols at them, bid the Meſſenger to unlock the Padlock of the Chains, which were faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Feet, and went under the Horſes Bellies. He told us, that not he, but one of the Provoſt's Men had the Keys of them; and having ſhew'd us the Perſon, we commanded him to unlock them. He refus'd to comply, which made one of the Gentlemen knock him down with the But end of his Fuzee, the reſt ſeeing us in earneſt betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Heels, ſo that he was forc'd to unlock
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65930:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Chains, and we deliver'd the two Priſoners, whom we conducted to theſe two Gentlemen's Father's Houſe, who was very angry with us, as fearing that this might prove the occaſion of great trouble to us.</p>
               <p>But the Mother, who was mov'd with Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them as well as we, got the young Woman in the Night time convey'd to <hi>Fontrevaure,</hi> where ſhe had a Siſter that was a Nun; and the young Fellow ſhe ſent to a neighbouring Gentleman, who was liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Soldiers, and might have the opportunity to convey him to a place of Safety.</p>
               <p>We were ſo fortunate as to hear no more of the Buſineſs; the Judges after they had examin'd the Provoſt's Men, being not very forward to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the matter any further, out of Compaſſion to the two Condemn'd Perſons. However, I thought it the ſureſt way for me, not to ſtay much longer in this place, for fear of a bad Iſſue; and therefore went to a Gentleman's Houſe, whoſe Name was <hi>Naze,</hi> and liv'd betwixt <hi>Lude</hi> and <hi>Samur.</hi> One day a Friend of his call'd <hi>Noyer</hi> coming to ſee him, and underſtanding that I was one who had nothing to loſe, he pitch'd upon me as a fit Inſtrument to aſſiſt him, in carrying away a certain young Widow, whom he pretended to be in Love with. There were two other Gentlemen, whoſe Names were St. <hi>Bonnets,</hi> that were to be concern'd in this matter, and the Marquiſs <hi>de Courcelles,</hi> Brother-in-law to the Marſhal <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> offer'd us his Houſe for a ſafe retreat, and lent his Coach, for the more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious carrying off of the Lady. We went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to her own Houſe, and as ſhe was coming down Stairs with one of us who had given her a Viſit, we took her up and hurried her into the Coach. Monſieur <hi>de Noyer</hi> begg'd her pardon for this Outrage, the fault of which he laid upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Love; that he ſhould never have had boldneſs enough to make ſuch an attempt, if he had not been inform'd that her Relations were urging her every day to prefer one <hi>Turpin</hi> before him, who indeed had a better Eſtate, but was not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65930:32"/>
by far of ſo good a Family, neither had he the ſame reſpect for her Perſon: Thus we carried her to the Caſtle of <hi>Courcelles,</hi> where they ſtay'd fourteen Days, during which time they conſtantly Eat, Drank and Bedded together.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Turpin</hi> had taken out Warrants againſt them, in the Name of her neareſt Relations, and the Provoſt of <hi>Man</hi> was ſent with his Followers to take us up, but durſt not venture to come into the Caſtle of <hi>Courcelles,</hi> knowing our Company to be too ſtrong for him there. The Widow was ſo cunning, as to perſwade Monſieur <hi>du Noyer,</hi> with whom ſhe liv'd very lovingly in all outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> would ſoon put a ſtop to all theſe Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by declaring that what had been done, was tranſacted with her own conſent. Monſieur <hi>de Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles</hi> and his Lady, who had ſeen her Careſs Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Noyer</hi> to the higheſt degree, and who had heard her ſay frequently, that ſhe was overjoy'd the thing had happen'd thus, not imagining any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were of opinion to conſent to her going. But ſhe was no ſooner got out of our Clutches, but the firſt time ſhe talk'd with <hi>Turpin,</hi> ſhe told him, that if he held ſtill his reſolution of marrying her, ſhe would ſtand to every thing he had done. <hi>Turpin</hi> ſwore that he had no other Intention; upon which, in lieu of performing her promiſe to us, ſhe was the firſt that made her Complaints both againſt <hi>Noyer,</hi> and all the reſt who had been aiding him in the matter: She ſent alſo ſeveral Provoſts with Warrants after us, in the Country to take us; ſo that thinking it our beſt way to ſeek for refuge elſewhere, and knowing that Monſieur <hi>de Courcelles</hi> had likewiſe been Summon'd to appear upon the ſame account, we left his Houſe. Monſieur <hi>du Noyer</hi> parted from us, and abſconded in ſome Friends Houſe, till he found means to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the matter under hand with <hi>Turpin,</hi> who had now Married the Widow.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65930:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Turpin</hi> having acquitted <hi>Noyer</hi> for a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he pretended the like from each of us, but as that did not agree with our preſent Circumſtances, ſo we reſolv'd not to part, but to make head againſt the Provoſts and their Followers. There was one among our Company who ow'd a ſpite to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of <hi>Ferte Beſnard,</hi> who was the chief Man that had undertaken the Buſineſs; and being reſolv'd to be reveng'd upon him at any rate, he found means to give the Provoſt to underſtand, that he with only one more were in an Inn, in the Town call'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolles en Beauce,</hi> whereas, in lieu of two there were a dozen of us. The Provoſt not ſuſpecting the matter, entred the Inn with four more of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, leaving four or five more at the Out Gates, for fear we ſhould make an eſcape, and he was very careful to lock the Doors, through which he enter'd, behind him, and thus put his Neck himſelf in the Nooſe. We ſoon diſarm'd him, the very ſight of ſo many of us, having robb'd him of all his Senſes.</p>
               <p>It was his ill Fortune to fall into the Hands of a Company of young hair brain'd Fellows, and who beſides that bore him a grudge, ſo that thoſe four of his Followers that enter'd the Room with him, had their Ears cut off: But the Provoſt himſelf did not eſcape ſo well, for we would not part with him till we had made him a true Eunuch. It happen'd juſt, that we had a Chirurgeon in our Company, who was fain to abſcond, becauſe he had kill'd his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, and it was he who gave the main ſtroak to rob the poor Fellow of his Manhood; but did it however with ſo much dexterity, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt eſcap'd with Life; and I underſtood that he was yet living, about five or ſix Years ago.</p>
               <p>But being ſenſible, that we muſt expect to be moſt ſeverely proſecuted, the two St. <hi>Bonnets</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to take us along with them into their Caſtle, which being very ſtrong, we might be in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to defend us, againſt thoſe that ſhould attempt to take us; and a good number of ſuch as were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65930:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under the ſame Circumſtances as we, flock'd to us every day, to ſhelter themſelves from Juſtice. But it was not long before we ſaw our ſelves beſieg'd by the <hi>Vice-Bailiff</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> aſſiſted by the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provoſts and their Followers. But we fir'd ſo briskly upon them, that having kill'd ſome of their Men, they withdrew without the reach of our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zees, thinking to force us to a Surrender by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but as we had foreſeen this Deſign, ſo we had made good Proviſions of all Neceſſaries, both for our Defence and Subſiſtence.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, there was but little likelihood for them to ſucceed in their Enterprize, they diſpers'd, intending to ſurprize us by ſome Stratagem or other. We began to conſult what was beſt to be done, and it being carry'd by the Majority that we ſhould not ſeparate, this being the way to be taken one after another; the next thing we had to conſider was, how to get Subſiſtence. The laſt Siege had been continu'd for ſix Weeks, in which time we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd moſt of our Proviſions; which convinc'd us, that if they ſhould give us ſuch another Viſit, we ſhould want both Proviſions and Ammunition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expedients were propos'd; but the beſt we could pitch upon was, to put the Neighbouring Country under Contribution, as it is commonly done in time of War. This being agreed upon by all, we made a Roll of all ſuch Places, as were to pay us contribution; nay we ſent the ſame Day ſome Parties abroad in the Country to Levy them; and I laid hold of this opportunity to get rid of this Company, foreſeeing that nothing but Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could attend ſuch a Raſh and Treaſonable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But I was very careful in diſguiſing my Intention; for I told them, that I intended only to ſee my Father, to provide my ſelf with ſome Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.</p>
               <p>After I had left the Caſtle and this Company of <hi>Banditti</hi>'s, I hid my ſelf in the day time in the Woods, and travell'd only in the Night, till I thought my ſelf out of danger. But there is no
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65930:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſecurity for thoſe who are purſu'd by a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which made me reſolve to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or at leaſt retire to ſome remote Garriſon, where I might live in hopes to eſcape that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had deſerv'd. With this Intention I came to my Father's Houſe, to bid him farewel; but not finding him at home, I told my Siſter, that it would be a great while before I ſhould ſee her again, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to let me have a little Money and a few Shirts, but ſhe was ſo hard hearted as to refuſe me both; thus I parted much diſſatisfy'd with her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinc'd that ſhe is a very ill-natur'd Creature. I met afterwards with the Marquiſs <hi>de Grancey,</hi> (who ſince dy'd Commander in Chief of a Squadron of Ships) who had ſome knowledge of me, having ſeen me with one of the Captains in his Regiment, who is a Kinſman of mine. I deſir'd he would take me along with him, pretending ſome buſineſs at <hi>Thionville,</hi> where his Regiment lay in Garriſon, which he did accordingly.</p>
               <p>But before I go further to tell you what became of me afterwards, I cannot paſs by in ſilence the deſtiny of that Company I had left, and how far I am indebted to God's Mercy, for having put it into my thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to leave theſe <hi>Deſperadoes.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions and Tyranny's they exercis'd, by their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſent abroad from the Caſtle, in the very heart of the King's Dominions, and in the very ſight of <hi>Paris,</hi> having ſoon reach'd the King's Ears; and a thing of this nature being look'd upon as inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a Detachment of the Guards was ſent, with ſome of the <hi>Grand Muſqueteers</hi> to reduce this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Crew. I don't know whether they had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the Storm, but certain it is, they appear'd not in the leaſt diſcourag'd at it. Deſpair was now to ſupply what they wanted in Courage; thus they defended themſelves to a miracle, refuſing to hearken to a Surrender. But after they had valiantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves for a conſiderable time, they were ſenſible they could not reſiſt the Aſſault, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they expected to be given every Moment. Seeing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65930:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
themſelves reduc'd to this extremity, they laid a Barrel of Gun-powder under one part of the Caſtle, and as they retir'd from Chamber to Chamber, they were purſu'd by the moſt forward of the Guards, when watching their opportunity, they ſet Fire to the Barrel of Powder, and ſo blew both themſelves and their Enemies up into the Air. A Siſter of Monſieur <hi>de St. Bonnets</hi> was among them, the Love ſhe bore to the <hi>Chevalier de Noſſay,</hi> whom ſhe was to have been Married to, having blinded her to that degree, as to chuſe the ſame Fate with her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Spouſe.</p>
               <p>I was in the mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while at <hi>Thionville,</hi> but in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſperate Condition, the late Peace taking away from me all hopes of making my Fortune in this Place, as by my late actions I was debarr'd from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to my own Country. But God Almighty, to whoſe Mercy I owed every thing before, and who, as it ſeems, had preſerv'd me for ſomething better, ſent to <hi>Thionville</hi> the Prince of <hi>Courland,</hi> who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to paſs that way as he was returning from <hi>Italy</hi> into his own Country. He was not above twenty Years of Age, and having ſeen me ſeveral times at the Marqueſs <hi>de Grancey</hi>'s, who was then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Thionville,</hi> he took ſuch liking to me, that he reſolved to take me along with him into <hi>Courland.</hi> His Father was alive, who being a Prince that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd his Revenue with a great deal of Prudence was very Rich in Money, which he improv'd by Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick. A War being at that time kindled betwixt the <hi>Emperor</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> he had made a Treaty with the <hi>Emperor</hi> to furniſh him with 4000 Men. He put his Son at the Head of theſe Troops, ſo that this young Prince, who had before made me his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Horſe, beſtowed beſides this upon me a Commiſſion of Enſign of his Guards. We joyn'd the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Forces about the middle of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, in the Year 1664. When alſo the <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries arrived in the Camp, being the day before the Battle fought near St. <hi>Godard.</hi>

There was no great Proſpect of any ſudden Action, there being not the leaſt probability that the <hi>Turks</hi> would Attempt to paſs the River in ſight of an Army not much Inferiour in Number to theirs.

                  <hi>de la Fevillade</hi> took this opportunity to give ſome Proof of his Valour and Conduct in the abſence of his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He ordered two Hundred <hi>French</hi> Horſe to ſwim over the River, with expreſs Orders to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, to Nail up the Cannon of a Battery, which gall'd his Souldiers, which was bravely executed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Turks</hi> were able to prevent it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Infidels</hi> having been convinc'd by this Action, that they could not expect any great ſucceſs on that ſide where the <hi>French</hi> were Poſted, reſolved to lay a Bridge over the River near the <hi>German</hi> Quarter, on which they were at work all that night; knowing that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had been extreamly fatigu'd all the Campaign, they did not queſtion but to ſurprize them; which ſucceeded ſo well, that twelve Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand paſs'd the River before the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had any notice of it: So that being Charg'd furiouſly by the <hi>Turks</hi> they were brought into Confuſion. The Duke <hi>de la Fevillade</hi> was no ſooner advertis'd of what had happen'd upon the Right Wing, but he march'd ſtraight to their Relief, and at the ſame time Commanded a Detachment to ruine their Bridge, to prevent the reſt from paſſing the River that way.</p>
               <p>This Detachment, which was in no ſmall danger of having been over-powered by the Enemy was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded ſo ſeaſonably by freſh Forces, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65930:35"/>
the vigorous Reſiſtance made by the Enemy, they broke the Bridge. The ſwiftneſs of the Current did indeed contribute much to the executing of their Deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as ſoon as they had broke down ſome part of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reſt was carried away by the violence of the Stream. The <hi>Turks</hi> being now without any hopes of being ſeconded, he Charg'd them at his eaſe, and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had thereby leaſure given them to rally, ſo that theſe 12000 <hi>Turks</hi> were no longer able to ſtand the brunt, but betook themſelves to Flight; the moſt of them were drowned, as they were endeavouring to re-paſs the River, very few of them that were on this ſide eſcaping with their Lives.</p>
               <p>This Victory prov'd the occaſion of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace betwixt theſe two Empires. The moſt were of opinion, that it would be for the Emperor's Intereſt to purſue his Victory; but it ſeems he had conceiv'd ſuch a Jealouſie, at the bravery the <hi>French</hi> ſhew'd in that Days Action, that ſetting aſide all other Conſiderations, he thought it beſt to ſend them forthwith back, which induc'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Truce with the <hi>Turks</hi> for a good many Years. The Prince of <hi>Courland</hi> was likewiſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd with his Troops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded by their Prince; partly becauſe the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> were in motion upon the Frontiers, and partly becauſe there was great appearance of a Rupture, betwixt <hi>Holland</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Courland,</hi> (the Father of him, who brought me along with him out of <hi>France</hi>) did wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he might treat about theſe Troops, with either of theſe two Parties, in caſe he ſhould have no occaſion for them himſelf.</p>
               <p>Knowing my ſelf a Stranger in this Country, I thought it to be my Intereſt to look about for ſome Friend, whoſe Authority might be able to ſupport me in a Court, where, as well as in all others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strangers are not look'd upon with a good Eye, if they are preferr'd before the Natives: It was upon this account I made my Addreſſes to the Governour
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65930:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the young Prince, whoſe Name was <hi>Vanaubin,</hi> and, who beſides this, was Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. He was a Perſon of great Integrity, and very obliging; and I muſt own, that I met with a very kind Reception from him. He had two very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Daughters, who learn'd to Dance from a <hi>French</hi> Maſter, who came every day to their Houſe. The Prince had a Niece, whoſe Name was Princeſs <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia Emilia;</hi> ſhe us'd often to come and ſee theſe two young Ladies, with whom ſhe frequently paſs'd her time in Dancing. The Dancing Maſter having told her once, that he ſaw a certain <hi>Frenchman</hi> go into <hi>Vanaubin</hi>'s Houſe, who Danc'd very well; the Princeſs was no ſooner Inform'd, that it was the Cornet belonging to her Couſins Guards, but ſhe ſent me word, that I ſhould come to wait on her. <hi>Vanaubin</hi> ſeeing one of her Servants ſpeak to me, ask'd what he wanted with me; and having told him, without the leaſt reſerve, what Errand he came upon, he was the firſt who advis'd me to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, becauſe perhaps the Princeſs <hi>Sophia</hi> had a mind to Dance with me. And it prov'd juſt as he told me, for ſhe ſo much delighted in Dancing, that as often as ſhe went to Monſieur <hi>Vanaubin</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhe would be ſure to let me know, that I might not fail to be there.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> began to give every day more and more Umbrage to this Court; which made <hi>Vanaubin,</hi> (who had heard me ſay, that one of the Chief Miniſters of the <hi>Czar</hi> was my Countryman) adviſe the Duke to ſend me into <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy.</hi> My Commiſſion was to endeavour to prevent an Invaſion from the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of this Miniſter. He was a <hi>Frenchman</hi> by Birth, his Name was <hi>Desjardins,</hi> being Couſin German to <hi>Madamoiſelle Desjardins,</hi> who has made her ſelf known in <hi>France,</hi> by ſeveral of her pieces of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. He very favourably receiv'd my Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Truce was concluded betwixt theſe two States for two Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> during which time, the Differences about the Limits, might be brought to a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65930:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fair Accommodation, it being impoſſible to be done at preſent, becauſe the <hi>Czar</hi> was ſomewhat crazed at that time.</p>
               <p>After my return from <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the Duke ſhew'd himſelf ſo extreamly well ſatisfy'd with my Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, that he diſpatch'd me forthwith into <hi>Holland,</hi> to offer to the States General, who were Engag'd in a War with the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> the ſame 4000 Men, that were not long before return'd out of <hi>Hungary.</hi> They did not think fit to accept of them, being in hopes of a conſiderable Succour from his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, who ſoon after ſent them ſome Forces, under the Command of Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>de Pondelles.</hi> I had Orders ſent me, to offer them likewiſe to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> in my return from <hi>Holland;</hi> but the Biſhop foreſeeing, that by the powerful Aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> he would ſoon be oblig'd to make Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and knowing beſides that they were not offer'd to him, till after they had been refus'd by them, he gave us many thanks for our kind offers. This Journey proving thus fruitleſs, I return'd into <hi>Courland,</hi> where in a little while after there happen'd an Accident, which oblig'd me to leave that Country.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>de Oſſane</hi> was fallen in Love with the before mention'd Princeſs <hi>Sophia,</hi> whom he deſir'd in Marriage. The Duke her Unkle did not diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the Match, but ſhe could not love the Count, and did not ſtick to ſhew her averſion to him to all the World. She would ſometimes make me take particular notice of his odd Behaviour. One Day the Count perceiving that we talk'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether concerning him, he ſtay'd till I had left the Princeſs, and then ask'd me what it was ſhe had told me. I anſwer'd, that we had talk'd nothing, but about indifferent Matters. I ſoon obſerv'd that this Anſwer, was in no wiſe ſatisfactory to him, for I heard him grumble as he went away from me, and the next Morning he came very boldly into my Chamber. He was no ſooner enter'd, but he Bolted the Door after him; and told me, that he ſhould not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65930:37"/>
have ſtay'd ſo long to tell me his Mind, if laſt Night, when he ſpoke to me, there had not been ſo many preſent to overhear him; That I was the occaſion he met with ſo ill a Reception from the Princeſs, and that he would make me repent it. After this ſhort Compliment he drew his Sword, and ſo did I to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing that all what I could ſay in my Juſtification would not take place with him. He was ſo overcome by his Paſſion, that he run Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon my Sword: Some that were in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber under mine, being ſurpriz'd at the Noiſe we made, came running up Stairs, and forcing the Door, prevented any further Miſchief.</p>
               <p>The Difference there was betwixt us, eſpecially in this Court, was look'd upon to be ſo great, that right or wrong I muſt come to the worſe, he being conſider'd as one, who might be one Day the Duke's Nephew, whereas I was only a poor Stranger, come there to ſeek my Fortune. And tho' it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſt, that he had been the occaſion of his own Misfortune. The Duke was ſo much exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt me, that he would not ſo much as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Son to ſpeak in my behalf. He forbid me alſo to appear at Court any more, which the Prince, who had a kindneſs for me, took ſo much to Heart, that he went to the Count, and notwithſtanding his Wounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us'd very rough Language to him. His Wound prov'd of no great conſequence, but was ſoon cur'd, when he went to <hi>Denmark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave from any Body; being not able to digeſt the Affront, he pretended to have receiv'd from the young Prince, who had ſided with me againſt him. Beſides, that he could no longer endure to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Princeſs, whom he intended to have made his Spouſe.</p>
               <p>As for my part, I receiv'd Orders from the young Prince, to ſtay for his coming at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> where he promis'd to meet me in three Weeks time. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go with me from thence to the Court of the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and to recommend me to that Prince. He came to <hi>Dantzick</hi> according
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65930:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to his Promiſe, and we travell'd from thence to <hi>Berlin,</hi> where the Elector was pleas'd to make me immediately, Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of Horſe, belonging to the Electoral Prince his Son. This was a new rais'd Regiment, which with ſome others, was to be ſent into <hi>Holland.</hi> We were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Sieges of <hi>Lockum</hi> and <hi>Dodecum,</hi> which were took from the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who after having declar'd War to the States, had taken theſe Places in the Province of <hi>Over-Yſſel.</hi>

On the Day of his Marriage there was a Ball at his Houſe, and ſome <hi>French</hi> Soldiers being refus'd Entrance, and gueſſing the reaſon of this refuſal, to have been their Soldier Dreſs, drew Lots among themſelves, which of them was to get in, to be reveng'd of them for the Affront given. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he whoſe Lot it was to undertake the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, dreſs'd himſelf in a Gold-lac'd Coat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the Houſe, he was no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Appartment where the reſt of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was, but he pull'd down his Breeches, and ſhew'd his Poſteriors to the whole Aſſembly. There was ſcarce any body there, but who was for throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him downrights out of the Window, but <hi>de Gent</hi> would not conſent to it, telling them, that ſome allowance ought to be given to his Youth, and that perhaps he was much in Drink, that when he ſhould be Sober again, he would be ready to cut his own Throat for his Miſdemeanour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65930:38"/>Thus by the Prudent Conduct of <hi>de Gent,</hi> this Matter would queſtionleſs have paſs'd over well enough, if Monſiieur <hi>d'Eſtrades</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour had not been inform'd of the Matter. He wrote to the King about it, who order'd that the Soldier ſhould be made an Example, to deter others from ſuch like Undertakings. <hi>De Gent</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Soldier was to be Try'd by a Court-Marſhal, was ſo generous as to Interceed for him, with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, who anſwer'd that his Hands were ty'd up, he having receiv'd expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King, to have him Condemn'd to Die.

The Princeſs of <hi>Tarente</hi> had two Ladies of Honour, who were both very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and greatly admir'd by all the Officers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, becauſe they had a very clear Reputation, a

thing more to be valu'd than Beauty. They had nevertheleſs each of them their Gallants, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam . . . . . had the moſt, her languiſhing Looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſides a thouſand other good Qualities, enough to Charm all the World. As for Mrs. <hi>la Motthe</hi> her Companion, ſhe was more lively and brisk; and they liv'd as lovingly together, as if they had been own Siſters. I had a moſt particular reſpect for Mrs. . . . . ., which being taken notice of by the Princeſs, ſhe propos'd a Match betwixt us two; and I for my part would have been the readieſt Man in the World to accept the offer, if I had been in a Condition to raiſe her Fortune: But, beſides that I had nothing to truſt to but my Place, and a ſmall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Money I had got whilſt I was in <hi>Courland;</hi> that which was the greateſt obſtacle to me, was the difference of Religion, ſhe being a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> and I a <hi>Catholick;</hi> and being, according to the Rules of my Religion, induc'd to believe that ſhe could not be ſav'd, I could not impetrate from my ſelf to Marry a Perſon, whom I muſt look upon as loſt to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, unleſs God would be pleas'd to take her into his peculiar Mercy. The Princeſs of <hi>Tarente,</hi> who was likewiſe a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> did leave no Stone unturn'd to bring me over to her Religion, making uſe of all the Perſwaſives that could be upon ſuch like an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and employ'd ſeveral of my particular Friends, in whom ſhe knew I had a great confidence, to back her endeavours; but I happily eſcap'd all theſe Snares, tho' at the ſame time I was catch'd in theſe of Mrs. . . . . . for I muſt confeſs, that I lov'd her to the higheſt degree, but could not reſolve to comply with what the Princeſs would have me do; Tho' it be true at the ſame time, that Mrs <hi>de Launay,</hi> whom I had eſpous'd in <hi>France,</hi> was alſo in ſome meaſure the occaſion of it, notwithſtanding that I look'd upon that Marriage as invalid.</p>
               <p>About that time the Duke of . . . . . happening to paſs through <hi>Hertogenbuſh</hi> in his return from <hi>Italy,</hi> paid a Viſit to the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Tarente.</hi> He no ſooner ſaw Mrs. . . . . but he fell as deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65930:39"/>
in Love with her, as my ſelf had done before. Being now guided by his Paſſion, he ſtay'd much longer than he intended at firſt, and us'd often to viſit theſe two Ladies in her Chamber, where he would have ſtay'd all day long, if Decency would have permitted him ſo to do. At laſt he diſcover'd his Paſſion to Mrs. . . . . making all the Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Imaginable, that his Love was not like that of many other Perſons of his Rank, but that he had ſo high an eſteem for her Perſon and Merits, that if ſhe would relie upon his Honour he would Marry her, notwithſtanding the great inequality of their Condition: That all that he deſir'd of her for the preſent was, that ſhe would confide ſo far in his Word and Honour, as to come to him at . . . . . . . where he would Marry her, before he would ask any Favour of her: That if ſhe would give him her Word ſo to do, he would ſend a Coach with Six Horſes to the <hi>Hague,</hi> which was to conduct her from thence into his Country; but that he deſir'd her, not to ſpeak a word of it to the Princeſs of <hi>Tarente,</hi> being unwilling ſhe ſhould know any thing of the Matter.</p>
               <p>This Precaution, together with the Duke's Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, created ſome Jealouſie in Mrs. . . . . for fear ſhe ſhould be drawn into an Error, of which ſhe might have occaſion to repent for ever after. She apply'd her ſelf therefore to her Confident Mrs. <hi>la Motthe,</hi> who advis'd her not to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity of raiſing her Fortune, being perſwaded that the Duke was a Perſon of more Honour, than to break his Word. The Princeſs <hi>de Tarente,</hi> would almoſt every day ask both of them, what made the Duke be ſo often in their Chamber, but did not in the leaſt think of what paſs'd there. In the mean while Mrs. . . . . was in a great perplexity what to reſolve upon; judging that ſhe could not, without the greateſt hazard to her Reputation, go to meet a Prince in his own Country: She ſet before her Eyes, that in caſe he ſhould happen to break his word with her, ſhe ſhould be the general Diſcourſe of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65930:39"/>
all <hi>Europe,</hi> which needs muſt impair her Reputation. But Mrs. <hi>la Motthe</hi> at laſt made her ſurmount all theſe Scruples, ſo that ſhe gave her word to the Duke to comply with his Requeſts; who told her at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that each Moment ſhe tarried here, was ſo much time loſt to compleat his ſatisfaction. It was therefore agreed upon, that the Duke was to ſend a Coach with Six Horſes for her, and that as ſoon as ſhe had receiv'd News of their ſafe arrival, ſhe was to go with Mrs. <hi>de la Motthe</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> under pretence of buying ſome Cloths: The Duke ſent accordingly a Letter from . . . . . appointing the day when the Coach ſhould be at the <hi>Hague;</hi> the Letter being addreſs'd to me, by the two young Ladies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, who alſo made choice of me to conduct them thither.</p>
               <p>I had no ſooner receiv'd the Letter, but ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways I went to Mrs. . . . . to deliver it to her, who thereupon deſir'd leave from the Princeſs, to go with Mrs. <hi>de la Motthe</hi> to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to buy themſelves ſome Neceſſaries: The Princeſs having granted their Requeſt, they were met at the <hi>Hague</hi> by the Duke's Coach, attended by his Gentleman of the Horſe and four Horſemen. After they had taken Coach, I return'd immediately to <hi>Hertogenbuſh,</hi> but ſaid not a word to any body of what I knew. No ſooner where they arriv'd at . . . . . but the Duke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his promiſe to Mrs. . . . . . whom he Married on the left Hand, as it is uſually done among Princes, and other Perſons of an Eminent Rank, when they Marry below their Quality. After he had Married her, he ſettl'd upon her the Country of <hi>H</hi> . . . . . by which Name ſhe was known for a conſiderable time after.

The States of the Country having in reſpect to her Perſon receded from their Ancient Cuſtom; and her Children will be Legal Heirs to their Fathers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65930:40"/>
Mrs. <hi>de la Motthe</hi> had likewiſe her ſhare in the good fortune of this Lady, the Duke having Married her to a <hi>Scotch</hi> Colonel, upon whom he has heap'd many Favours. Thus they left the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Tarente,</hi> who was extreamly ſurpriz'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what good Fortune was befaln them.</p>
               <p>The good underſtanding which had hitherto been cultivated betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abate by degrees, the laſt being grown jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Kings Power: For not long after he had aſſiſted them againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> he was enter'd <hi>Flanders,</hi> where meeting with no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he had made ſeveral Conqueſts, which made the <hi>Dutch</hi> look upon them with a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Eye, for fear if he ſhould make himſelf Maſter of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Neitherlands, the next turn would be theirs. Seeing therefore themſelves under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for weighty Reaſons of State to counterbalance the growing power of this Monarch, they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Allyance with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> in order to oblige him to make Peace with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The King who all that time was not arrived to that pitch of Greatneſs he has appear'd in ſince, was fain to be contented with what Conqueſts he had made, rather than to engage himſelf in a War, the Iſſue of which might perhaps have prov'd of dangerous conſequence.</p>
               <p>A Peace being thus concluded upon leſs advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Terms for <hi>France</hi> than if they had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled in the buſineſs, they reſolved alſo to ſend home all the reſt of the Auxiliaries, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining as yet in their Service; not but that they were obliged, by vertue of a Treaty made with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> to keep theſe Troops in Pay, but Flattering themſelves that they ſhould ſcarce have any occaſion for them for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time after: they found means to make the ſaid Elector take them again. Orders were ſent us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, to get every thing ready for our March into <hi>Brandenburgh;</hi> but before I left <hi>Holland</hi> there happen'd a very pleaſant adventure to me, of which I will give you an Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65930:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>A certain <hi>French</hi> Lord, call'd the Count <hi>de Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi> of the Family of the Dukes of <hi>Rovanez,</hi> was Married in <hi>Holland</hi> to Madam <hi>Riperda,</hi> a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Quality in the Province of <hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her into <hi>France,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>de Riperda</hi> her Brother, came to ſee them. He ſoon fell in love with Madam <hi>de Caravas</hi> his Brother in Law's Siſter, who knowing him to be an Advantageous Match, by reaſon of his great Eſtate, receiv'd his Addreſſes, without much reluctancy. There was only one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle which did puzzle them for ſome time, which was, that he was not of Age, and that his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive, his whole dependance was on him. But flattering themſelves that in reſpect of her Quality, and the near Alliance that was already betwixt the two Families, the Father would be prevail'd upon to give his conſent, they were Married together. The young <hi>Riperda</hi> return'd not long after into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he Married another at <hi>Hertogenbuſh,</hi> as if he had not left a Wife in <hi>France.</hi> This laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Actreſs by Profeſſion, his Parents were ſo exaſperated at it, that they found means to ſend her away to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Caravas,</hi> who had notice given her of the infidelity of her Husband, and that he ſlighted her upon all occaſions, nor would acknowledge her for his Wife, reſolved to go into <hi>Holland;</hi> and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to arrive at the <hi>Hague</hi> much about the ſame time that the young <hi>Riperda</hi> and I were diverting our ſelves there. She had diſguis'd her ſelf in Men's Habit, as well as her Waiting Gentlewoman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be known by any body. The firſt thing ſhe did was to ſend her Gentlewoman, who had all the appearance of a Gentleman to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perda,</hi> who told him, that he was ſent by a certain Kinſman of Madam <hi>de Caravas,</hi> that he was not Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of her Quality, and could not but be ſenſible of the Injury he had done her, to revenge which, he was reſolved to meet him with his Sword in hand. He anſwer'd this pretended Gentleman, that he need not ſtay for an anſwer, but that he might tell Madam
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65930:41"/>
                  <hi>de Caravas</hi> her Kinſman, that he ſhould hear from him in two hours time at fartheſt. His deſign was to apply himſelf to my Lord <hi>Webbenum</hi> his Uncle, who being Preſident of the States, he did not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by his Authority to have both theſe Challengers taken up.</p>
               <p>It happen'd ſo that I came to ſee him within a Minute after, and ſeeing him extreamly diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I managed him ſo long, till at laſt he told me the whole Truth, and what his deſign was, for which I gave him a ſevere Rebuke; I told him that this was the way to loſe himſelf for ever in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all the World, who would take him for a rank Coward if he ſhould refuſe to give Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to theſe Gentlemen, who had Travell'd 200 Leagues on purpoſe to call him to an account. He pretended to give way to my perſwaſions, and ſent me to let them know that he would meet them at ſuch an hour on the Sea-ſide near <hi>Shevelingen:</hi> But in Lieu of performing his Promiſe, he perſiſted in his former deſign to have them Seiz'd there; when I found what his deſign was, I went ſtreight ways to the place of appointment to give them notice of what was likely to befall them, where I found them before me, but not in a condition to Fight: For my Lord <hi>Webbenum</hi> had taken care to have them ſecur'd, which put them upon the neceſſity of diſcovering their Sex and Quality, ſo they were ſet at Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the ſame <hi>Webbenum</hi> procured an order from the States, enjoyning them to leave the Country. Madam <hi>de Caravas</hi> retir'd to <hi>Vianen</hi> a ſmall Soveraignity near <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht</hi> independent in ſome meaſure from the Province of <hi>Holland.</hi> From thence ſhe writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Monſieur <hi>de Eſtrade</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, complaining of the Affront put upon her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his protection. Monſieur <hi>de Eſtrade,</hi> having made his Complaint to the States, ſhe had leave given her to return to the <hi>Hague.</hi> She ſent a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to <hi>Riperda,</hi> to ſhew Cauſe, why her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhould not ſtand good; but having to deal with a very Potent Adverſary in a Country where ſhe was a Stranger, ſhe loſt the Cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65930:41"/>In a little while after I return'd into the Country of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> with all the Troops of his Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſs, that had been in the States ſervice, which amounted to about 4000 Men. I had my Quarters aſſign'd me at <hi>Altenoe,</hi> where one <hi>Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> a Colonel of Horſe, and a Gentleman of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Extraction, whoſe Father had been Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſame place before him; He had a youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother, who was Captain in the ſame Regiment and one Siſter, who liv'd in a kind of a <hi>Nunnery,</hi> ſuch as they have among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which was called <hi>Hegenhurſt.</hi> She was not above fifteen Years old, and very handſom, beſides that ſhe had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Portion.</p>
               <p>Not long after my arrival, I went to <hi>Berlin</hi> to appear at Court and pay my reſpects to his Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who, as well as the Electoreſs, having ask'd me where I was Quarter'd at preſent, I told her at <hi>Altenoe.</hi> The Electoreſs had no ſooner heard me ſpeak theſe words, but ſhe ſaid to the Elector, we muſt have him married with Mrs. <hi>Frankenſtein;</hi> and then turning towards me, ſhe ask'd whether I knew her? I told her, I did not, but that I had heard much of her. The Elector had given me ſeveral Proofs of his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inclinations towards me, and being as it ſeems, willing to engage me for ever in his Service, he ſpoke to me again at another time, concerning this Match, and had the goodneſs to give me a Letter of Recommendation to the Abbeſs, requiring her to let me viſit the young Lady, and to aſſiſt me in my deſign; it being his intention I ſhould Marry the Lady. After my return from <hi>Berlin,</hi> I went accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to viſit her, and having found her in a good diſpoſition, we agreed among our ſelves upon the Match, for I deſired her from the beginning not to ſpeak of it to any Body living, for fear her Brothers ſhould endeavour to obſtruct our deſign.</p>
               <p>We conſummated the Match in a few days after, which being ſoon come to the knowledge of her Brothers, who happen'd at that time to be in the Country of <hi>Cleves,</hi> they return'd with all ſpeed to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65930:42"/>
                  <hi>Altenoe,</hi> and threatned no leſs than Death to me; neither did their Malice end in Threats, for they indeavour'd by all means poſſible to make me hated by my Spouſe, in hopes that when they had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted their deſign; which was to take her away from me, ſhe might be the ſooner diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a diſſolution of the Marriage.</p>
               <p>This will perhaps appear ſomewhat ſtrange to moſt People, it being ſcarce to be imagined, how they could pitch upon ſuch a reſolution, ſince their Siſters Honour muſt needs ſuffer by it. But beſides that, Self-intereſt made them blind to all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, it is to be obſerv'd that in thoſe Parts, if a young Lady happens to have a miſchance, ſhe is not look'd upon much the worſe for ſuch a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; they being not ſo Nice in that point as we are, and provided ſhe prove Virtuous afterwards the Husband never takes notice of what is paſt.</p>
               <p>I for my part, did make no great account upon what I heard told concerning the Threatning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my Brothers-in-law, all the Anſwer I gave to thoſe that ſpoke of it to me, was, that if they did aſſault me, I did not queſtion to make my party good with them. This being told them again, they were more exaſperated againſt me than ever; ſo that having got notice that I was one time gone abroad, the youngeſt Brother, who was the moſt violent againſt me, pitch'd upon this as the moſt ſeaſonable opportunity to enter my Houſe, believing that the Servants would not dare to oppoſe him. But my Gentleman, to whom I had given expreſs Orders to let neither of the two Brothers, nor any of their acquaintance come into the Houſe; ſeeing that, they opened the door to him, and that he was making the beſt of his way to his Siſter's Chamber, drew his Sword to oppoſe him, crying out aloud to the reſt of the Servants to come to his aſſiſtance, their Maſter's Honour lying now at ſtake. My Brother-in-law was almoſt Drunk when he entred the Houſe, ſo that being hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the violence of his Paſſion, and the hot fumes of the Wine, he run himſelf upon my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65930:42"/>
Sword, and fell immediately upon the Ground, wallowing in his own Blood. He had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven or eight Troopers and Servants along with him, who ſeeing him in this condition, took him up, and carried him to the next Chirurgeon, who provided him a Bed, he being ſo Weak as not to be ſent without great danger to his own Houſe.</p>
               <p>The People who had always a particular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for that Family, ſurrounded my Houſe, and forcing the Doors laid hold on my Gentleman, whom they abuſed, beat, and carried to Priſon. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law dying within two days after, my Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was accuſed of Murther, which put me hard to it; for I look'd upon it as Barbarous to ſee my Servant Die having been Faithful to me, and on the other hand, I was unwilling to diſoblige my Spouſe, who had engag'd me not to ſolicite his pardon. I pitch'd therefore upon a <hi>Medium,</hi> ſo as to avoid diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her, and at the ſame time to preſerve a Perſon whoſe Misfortune proceeded only from having been too Faithful to me. I found means to get a Copy of what had been Depoſed againſt him, which I ſent to the Marqueſs <hi>de Beauveau Depence,</hi> who was my intimate Friend, and in great Eſteem with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. I begg'd of him to ſpeak to the Elector in my behalf, and to repreſent to him, that I had E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed my Wife upon his Recommendation, and that if my Servant muſt ſuffer Death for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Maſter's Honour, I could not expect for the future to live in ſecurity my ſelf. The Elector being inform'd exactly of what had paſs'd, diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the matter with Monſieur <hi>Fuchs</hi> Preſident of his Council, who being of the ſame Opinion with the Elector, that my Servant's Misfortune had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd rather by a Miſchance than any intended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; he ſent Orders to the Priſon-keeper to let him go, before Sentence could paſs againſt him. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Depence</hi> order'd me at the ſame time to ſend him forthwith back into <hi>France,</hi> without letting him as much as enter my Houſe: This being his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highneſſes expreſs Command, who had Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65930:43"/>
him upon this Condition. Accordingly I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with what was neceſſary for his Journey, and gave him beſides this, a good Gratuity for the Service he had done me; but in lieu of returning into <hi>France</hi> where he was born, he went to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> where he had a Brother living who was Married in that place.</p>
               <p>The late Monſieur <hi>Frankenſtein,</hi> my Father-in-law, had, after the Death of my Wife's Mother, Married a young Lady of Quality out of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was a Couſin German of his firſt Wife, but much hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer than ſhe, at leaſt as I have heard it ſaid, for I never ſaw my Mother-in-law. She had got ſuch an aſcendant over my Father-in-law, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed her with all that he could, nay even with more than he ought to have done; for he preſented her with Jewels, Pearls, and other ſuch like things to a great value, which had been my Mother-in-laws; and which ſhe with his conſent had left by her laſt Will to my Spouſe. This laſt Lady had been ſo cunning as to alter moſt of them, ſo as ſcarce to be known again, hoping to defraud my Wife of them by this means; but ſome few Years before I was Married to my Spouſe, my Father-in-Law hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to die, whilſt to her Misfortune, ſhe was juſt abſent, and in <hi>Denmark;</hi> having left her Jewels and a good Sum of Gold, which ſhe had pick'd up ſince her Marriage, in a Cabinet. The Eldeſt of my Wife's Brothers, who knew of the matter, and was much diſſatisfied at my Father's over-eaſineſs, had not Charity enough to give her notice of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but did not ſend her the leaſt word till after he was Dead, and whilſt ſhe was upon her Journey out of <hi>Denmark</hi> he laid hold of all what ſhe had hoarded up in the Cabinet, which at her return ſhe found empty. This occaſioned a Law-ſuit betwixt them, but wanting evidence to prove the Matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſhe was adviſed to let the Matter remain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſuſpence.</p>
               <p>My Brother-in-law being of a weak Conſtitution and Conſumptive beſides, he reſolved never to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

knowing that Marrying would be the readieſt way to haſten him to his Grave; yet he could not eſcape his deſtiny, for it was not long after my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, before he took his bed, and finding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady encreaſe paſt remedy, he was deſirous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to his Siſter. She being ſent for, and come to his Bed-ſide, he expreſs'd his ſorrow for what was paſt, and at the ſame time delivered to her all the Jewels, and other precious Movables he found in the Cabinet; telling her, that ſhe need not ſcruple to receive them, they having always belong'd to the Family. He died in a few days after, and my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law renewed the Law-ſuit againſt me, but being as deſtitute of Witneſſes, as ſhe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhe let it drop once more.</p>
               <p>After the death of my Wife's Brother, many put in for the Governour's place, vacant by his death; and the Electoral Prince made uſe of his Intereſt for the Count <hi>de Zoleſtine,</hi> who was his Favourite; for my part, I had not the leaſt thoughts of it, conſidering that what little Service I had done to His Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Highneſs, could not in the leaſt raiſe me to the pretenſion of ſuch a place as this. But as his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had ſhew'd me very evident marks of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour upon ſeveral occaſions before, ſo at this time he gave me the moſt convincing proof of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, beyond whatever I could have expected from him; For he ask'd me in the preſence of the whole Court, what was the reaſon that I was the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that did not put in for the Governors place which had been in the Hands both of my Brother and Father-in-law, ſince, as being their Heir, I had a more juſt pretence than others. I made a profound Reverence, and at the ſame time told his Highneſs, That I had not the Confidence to pretend to ſo great a Favour, thinking my ſelf already Rewarded beyond what I deſerv'd, by what Favours he had been pleas'd to beſtow upon me before; but that I would lay hold of all opportunities to endeavour to ſhew my ſelf not altogether unworthy of them. His Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Highneſs anſwered me, That I ought to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65930:44"/>
no loſer for my Modeſty's ſake, which deſerving a proportionable Reward, he would beſtow the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon me; That I ſhould continue to ſerve him well, which would be an inducement to him, to heap upon me more Favours than he had done before. This good Fortune, which came much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my expectation, prov'd however the occaſion that I was ever after look'd upon with a very ill Eye by the Electoral Prince, tho' againſt all Reaſon, as is apparent from what I have ſaid juſt now. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before I proceed in the recital of my Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and what Reaſons induc'd me to avoid his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which I was afraid one time or other might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce very ill conſequences on my ſide; I judge it not amiſs to inſert ſome paſſages relating to publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, there being a ſtrict connexion betwixt thoſe Matters I am to relate in theſe Memoirs, and them, by which it may appear, in what manner I conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Affairs in theſe Junctures.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>LEWIS</hi> the Great having for very weighty Reaſons of State, taken a Reſolution to humble the Pride of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Alliance with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome other Princes Bordering upon the Lower <hi>Rhine,</hi> to declare War againſt them. There was not one of all the Neighbouring Princes, but what was very glad of this opportunity; and the Elector of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65930:45"/>
himſelf would queſtionleſs have entered into this Alliance, if Reaſons of State had not over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd his Inclinations, for he had indeed more Weighty matters of Complaint againſt them than the other Princes, for they exerciſed a Sovereign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in the moſt conſiderable Places of the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> whereas by Contract, they were only to Garriſon them for their own ſecurity: But conſidering that they had already Enemies enough to humble them, it was not his Intereſt to ſee them quite deſtroy'd. He was alſo ſufficiently convinced, that when they ſaw themſelves entangled in ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom a War, they would be under a neceſſity of making their Applications to him; and that in that Juncture, it would be more ſuitable to his Intereſt, to prevent than to promote their Deſtruction. He knew that if he ſhould engage in a War, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the neceſſary precautions, he might chance to be Attack d either by <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Sweden;</hi> the firſt of which watch'd all opportunities to recover the Ducal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> the laſt to Conquer the remaining part of <hi>Pomerania.</hi> It was theſe conſiderations were ſo prevailing with the Elector, that when the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſolicited for Succours, he propoſed ſuch hard Conditions to them, that they did not think fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them. For the Elector pretended no leſs than the Reſtitution of all thoſe places in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> flattering themſelves with hopes to prevent the irruption of the <hi>French,</hi> (who were not as then yet entered the <hi>Dutch</hi> Territories) by making their ſubmiſſion to the King; or elſe to come to an Accommodation with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they would not buy his Aſſiſtance at ſo dear a Rate, and thus the Treaty broke off. In the mean while the Elector foreſeeing that the Alliance betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> was laid upon ſuch a Baſis and cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the common Intereſt of theſe two Kings, that the ſame would not be eaſily diſſolved, he ſent his Miniſter to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court, to make exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, how the deſigns of <hi>France</hi> were reliſh'd by the Emperor, and if he found that he began to be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65930:45"/>
Jealous of this <hi>French</hi> Irruption, to declare to his Imperial Majeſty, that his Maſter was ready to join his Forces with the Imperialiſts, to prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The prodigious ſucceſs which attended his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Arms, did encreaſe this Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; for in ſix Weeks time, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reduc'd to ſo low an ebb of Fortune, that all their paſs'd Glory did appear no otherwiſe than the Sun in an Eclipſe. For the King had in the two Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> in the Year 1672, taken from them above Forty ſtrong Places, ſome of which had held out formerly a great while, againſt very formidable Armies. In the number of thoſe, were thoſe Places in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves,</hi> belonging to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh;</hi> and as he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee them in the <hi>Dutch</hi> than in the <hi>French</hi> hands, he ſhew'd more forwardneſs now to hearken to the Propoſitions made to him by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to march to their Relief.</p>
               <p>The Emperor who took the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts as much to heart as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves, did alſo join his Intereſt with theirs, the ſooner to prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Elector to come to their aſſiſtance. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd that as ſoon as the Elector's Troops were on their March, thoſe of the Empire ſhould be ready to join them, by which means they hop'd to coop up the <hi>French,</hi> their Army not being very numerous upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> at that time, becauſe they had diſpers'd moſt of their Troops in the new Conqueſts. If the advice of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had taken place, who foreſaw that this ſtupendious ſucceſs would certainly alarm thoſe who were jealous of the <hi>French</hi> Power; moſt of theſe Places were to have been diſmantl'd, the Garriſons of which would have been ſufficient to bring two or three good Armies into the Field, which would have prov'd the only means to keep the Neighbouring Princes in awe, and to prevent their declaring againſt <hi>France.</hi> But his advice being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd by thoſe of a contrary Sentiment, this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned the Elector to take up Arms againſt the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65930:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King, and a Treaty was concluded betwixt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Emperor and <hi>Hollanders</hi> to ſuccour one another. The Elector's Army conſiſted of about 25000 Men, but for the moſt part new Levies, not one half of them being old Troops. The Emperor's Forces were no leſs numerous, and Commanded by <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculi,</hi> a General of great Reputation, and who was grown old in the Exerciſe of the Art of War. In the Elector's Army nothing was more talk'd of, than how they would ſwallow up the <hi>French</hi> Army, which indeed was not then above ten or twelve Thouſand ſtrong, their Forces being diſpers'd in ſo many Garriſons. Thus fluſh'd with hopes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering all before us, we march'd as to an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Victory. We enter'd <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> that part which belong'd to the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> who ſtood then in alliance with <hi>France,</hi> and had no Forces in thoſe parts to diſpute our paſſage. The Elector who Commanded in Perſon, took care to have an exact Diſcipline obſerv'd there, being in hopes of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Biſhop over to the Emperor's Party, whoſe Subject he was. From thence we march'd into the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi>'s Territories, where we liv'd at diſcretion, pillaging where ever we came; This Prince being ſuppos'd ſo firmly link'd to the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> that nothing but the total deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Country, could ſeparate him from it. We beſieg'd <hi>Werle,</hi> and as we were carrying on our approaches, Intelligence was given us, that the Marſhal <hi>de Turenne</hi> had paſs'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> with 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or 14000 Men, all choſen Troops, to give us Battle.</p>
               <p>The great renown of this General ſtruck ſuch a Terror among us, that tho' we were at leaſt as ſtrong again, yet we rais'd the Siege, not without ſome precipitation. <hi>Turenne</hi> march'd after us, and the Elector drew back into the Country of <hi>Marche,</hi> not believing that <hi>Turenne</hi> would follow him ſo far. In the mean while he diſpatch'd Meſſenger after Meſſenger to <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> to know the reaſon why he did not come to join him. But ſome inteſtine Commotions in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where a Conſpiracy had
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65930:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been lately diſcover'd againſt the Emperor, had been the occaſion that this General advanc'd but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlowly; and tho' he had begun his March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he did not march at any great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Vienna. Turenne,</hi> who muſt paſs the River <hi>Weſer,</hi> before he could enter the Country of <hi>Marche,</hi> took the Towns of <hi>Hamme, Zoeſt</hi> and <hi>Alſet,</hi> ſituate upon the ſaid River; and having left in each of them a good Garriſon, he paſs'd the ſaid River, and march'd towards us. We Entrench'd our ſelves near the Banks of the River <hi>Lippe,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to hazard a Battle, which gave him the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Bielfeldt, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vensburgh</hi> and <hi>Lipſtadt,</hi> where he paſs'd the River <hi>Lippe,</hi> driving us before him like a Herd of Sheep, as far as to the utmoſt Frontiers of the Country of <hi>Marche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence the Elector ſent Monſieur <hi>de Beauveau Depence</hi> to <hi>Turenne,</hi> offering to lay down his Arms, under condition that the King ſhould withdraw his Troops from his Territories, and reſtore to him the places belonging to him in the Dutchy of <hi>Cleves;</hi> that for the reſt he would ſtand Neuter during this War, and would renounce the Treaty made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The King accepted theſe Propoſitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after his Troops had almoſt ruin'd the Country, where they had taken up their Winter Quarters. I paſs'd that Winter at <hi>Altenoe,</hi> where I was ſeiz'd with a moſt violent Fever, ſo that my Life being deſpair'd of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I prepar'd my ſelf for Death, by receiving the Sacraments; but it pleas'd God to diſpoſe otherwiſe of me, and I was reſtor'd to Health, before the beginning of the next following Campaign.</p>
               <p>I was extreamly rejoyc'd at the Peace made with the Elector, which deliver'd me from that reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which I always found in my ſelf to ſerve againſt my King: For tho' I had married a Native of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and had my Eſtate and a conſiderable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment there, yet what I did was againſt my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Neither my two Children born there,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65930:47"/>
neither the proſpect I had of advancing my Fortune, to a much higher degree than I could reaſonably propoſe to my ſelf in <hi>France,</hi> were motives ſtrong enough to hinder me from wiſhing frequently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into my own Country: And not to diſſemble the truth, I had done it long before, if the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the ill ſtate of my Affairs there, which had made me leave <hi>France,</hi> had not retarded my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>But my Joy did not laſt long. The Elector hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been once more Intreated by the Emperor to join his Forces with him, the troubles in <hi>Hungary</hi> being now appeas'd, broke the Treaty ſo lately made with our King; and ſeveral others of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Princes, declar'd at the ſame time againſt him; ſo that if <hi>England</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had done like the reſt, the Confederacy againſt <hi>France,</hi> would have been the ſame it has been of late. Of all the Princes that were enter'd into a League with our King, there was none that remain'd ſtedfaſt, except the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> and that not very long, being forc'd by the Enemy, who ſurrounded him on all ſides, to do like the reſt. The Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> notwithſtanding he was Father-in-law to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was one of the firſt who left the <hi>French</hi> Party, whoſe example the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, but rather out of neceſſity than by his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. But neither the conjunction of theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with thoſe of the Emperor's, nor the <hi>Spaniards</hi> declaring at the ſame time againſt <hi>France,</hi> was half ſo much ſurprizing to the King, as the Peace made between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the Year 1674.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great ſaw himſelf under an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to carry on a War alone, againſt ſo many Princes enter'd into a confederacy againſt him. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> took a review of his Troops, which conſiſted of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0000 Men, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the new Levies. The Confederates had projected great deſigns, as being perſwaded that the King would not be able to cope with them all;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65930:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Some were for entring <hi>France,</hi> others for retaking all the places they had loſt many Years before. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt was the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who having by his ill Conduct loſt his Dominions, flatter'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now, with hopes to be put in poſſeſſion of them again. Upon this conſideration it was he embrac'd the Confederate ſide, who indeed, knowing him to be a Perſon, who in all his Life time, had never made any account of his Word, did truſt him no further than they needs muſt.</p>
               <p>Our Army advanc'd towards the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and I was detach'd before the Elector's arrival, with 500 Men, to maintain my ſelf in . . . . . in caſe I ſhould be attack'd there; it being fear'd, that whilſt we were near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> might attempt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irruption into the Country of <hi>Marche,</hi> where this place is ſituate. And it really happen'd ſo: For the Marquiſs <hi>de Renet</hi> beſieg'd the Place, and I was forc'd to ſurrender, after ſeventeen days opening of the Trenches. I was ſorely afraid to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to be a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> but hearing me ſpeak good <hi>High-Dutch</hi> as I march'd out of the Place, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to the Contrary, I was ſafely conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Crinburgh,</hi> purſuant to the Capitulation.</p>
               <p>This Campaign was ſo far from anſwering the expectation of the Confederates, that nothing but Ruin and Deſtruction attended them: <hi>Turenne,</hi> who before was become famous for his great Actions, did in this Campaign deſervedly acquire the Title of the greateſt Captain in <hi>Europe,</hi> having upon this occaſion given moſt evident demonſtrations to the World, what a good Conduct, founded upon a long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is able to effect. For it was he that had a true foreſight of what was likely to happen on that ſide, and it was he that prevented the King from quitting <hi>Alſace,</hi> as it had been reſolved in a Cabinet Council, held at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> He found means to beat the Allies one after another, who were under a neceſſity of dividing their Forces, for want of good Magazines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65930:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>In the mean while, the Flame of the War which was firſt kindl'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> began to ſpread over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Countries, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having declar'd in favour of <hi>France</hi> againſt the Confederates. <hi>Sweden</hi> had been for a conſiderable time in the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>France;</hi> and the reaſon why they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſooner for our ſide was, becauſe the King had pitch'd upon that Crown, to mediate a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the Confederates; and Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries were ſent for that purpoſe to <hi>Cologne,</hi> the Place appointed for the Treaty. But the Allies ſtill flattering themſelves, that <hi>France</hi> was not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hold out long againſt their joint Forces, ſought only for Means to break off this Treaty, which they had ſet on foot with an intention only to gain time, the better to take their Meaſures againſt us. For this purpoſe they took an opportunity to ſeize upon Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Furſtenburgh</hi> at <hi>Cologne,</hi> Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> whom they carried to <hi>Bonn,</hi> and from thence further into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> where he was kept in Priſon, and treated in a manner ſo little ſuitable to his Quality, that he was forc'd to wear one of his Shirts all to pieces, before they would let him have another.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> made heavy Complaints againſt it, looking upon it as a violation of the Laws of Nations, and an Affront put upon him as Mediator; but the Emperor refuſing to give the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd ſatisfaction, he declar'd for <hi>France. Wrangel,</hi> who Commanded the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army, advanced thereupon to the Frontiers of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> which made the Elector to withdraw his Forces from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and to advance with all poſſible ſpeed, at the Head of us, to the Banks of the River <hi>Rhe,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the Paſſage to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army. But having paſs'd the River before he took <hi>Floz</hi> and . . . . . . Places Situate upon the utmoſt Frontiers of the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Territories, he made himſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Maſter of the two Forts of <hi>Ribnitz</hi> and <hi>Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz,</hi> and might have extended his Conqueſts into the very heart of the Country, if he had been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65930:48"/>
in what a conſternation his March had put the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Army. But whether the Elector had found means to corrupt him with Money, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a pannick fear ſeiz'd upon the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they march'd back all on a ſudden, and repaſs'd the <hi>Rhe,</hi> without attempting any thing further.</p>
               <p>The Elector, who feared, not without reaſon, that alone he ſhould ſcarce be ſufficient to cope with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> entered into an Alliance with the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick Lunenburgh,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Duke of <hi>Hanouer,</hi> who would not joyn with them, but rather declared for the other ſide. The General <hi>Rasfeld</hi> who then Commanded the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> Forces, Beſieg'd <hi>Locknitz,</hi> and <hi>Wrangel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolv'd to Relieve it, coſt what it would, paſſ'd the <hi>Rhe</hi> at <hi>Wollin,</hi> and advanc'd with his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a great Bog and Foreſt, which extended from <hi>Wollin</hi> to <hi>Locknitz. Rasfeld</hi> having receiv'd timely intelligence of his March, left as many Troops before <hi>Locknitz,</hi> as were ſufficient to guard the Trenches; with the reſt he march'd againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who retreated at the firſt Charge. Some of them got to <hi>Wollin,</hi> the reſt fled into the Woods, where they could not eaſily be purſu'd, by reaſon of the thickneſs of it, which would have endanger'd thoſe that purſu'd them. The <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> took about 1500 Priſoners, and kill'd 800, with the loſs of about half the Number on their ſide; but the <hi>Swedes</hi> did not carry off one Priſoner. <hi>Wrangel</hi> happening to die not long after, and the Command of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army being given to the General <hi>Sharenbergh,</hi> he took a reſolution to beſiege <hi>Enfield,</hi> to ſignalize himſelf by this Enterprize. All this happen'd in the Campaign of 1675.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> who was at that time at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to confer with the reſt of the Confederate Princes, had no ſooner receiv'd the News of the Victory obtain'd by General <hi>Rasfeld,</hi> but he haſtn'd with all poſſible ſpeed, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Head of his Army. The River of <hi>Lingn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> was betwixt us and the Enemy, and they could not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65930:49"/>
Beſiege <hi>Enfield</hi> before they had paſs'd that River, ſo that we directed our March thither to diſpute their Paſſage. The Elector having receiv'd Intelligence, that they had ſeiz'd upon ſome Boats, and the Ferry-Boat, betwixt <hi>Enclin</hi> and <hi>Enfield,</hi> in order to lay a Bridge over the ſaid River, and that they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun to paſs it, order'd us to haſten our March, in hopes we might come time enough to prevent them. As we approach'd the Bank of the River, we found about 4000 of the Enemy, who being already paſs'd the River, were charg'd ſo briskly, that few of them eſcap'd our Hands.</p>
               <p>Thus the War being carried on with more Heat than ever, the Elector ſent me back to <hi>Altenoe,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt the Enemy ſhould have a Deſign upon that place, and his foreſight was not ill grounded; for I was cloſely Beſieged in the next Campaign. As this Seige was not unexpected to me, ſo I had often ſolicited at Court to provide the place with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, which however I could not obtain. This made me take a reſolution to ſeize upon all that I found in the Circumjacent places, which I judg'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make a Vigorous Defence. <hi>Coningsmark,</hi> who then Commanded the <hi>Swedes,</hi> in lieu of <hi>Sharen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> came to view the place, of which I gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate notice to the Elector, who ſent me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Re-inforcement; but 500 only got into the place, the reſt being forced to retire. <hi>Coningsmark,</hi> had no ſooner finiſhed his Lines of Circumvallation, but he Attack'd the Fort <hi>Ravent,</hi> which he took by Compoſition. After this he carried on his Attack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another Fort, called the Bridge-Fort, which he alſo took. I took care to ſend Orders to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, not to hold it out to the laſt extremity, but they not obeying my Commands, were all made Priſoners of War; and the <hi>Swedes</hi> finding among them a Serjeant and four common Soldiers, who had Deſerted, they Hang'd them in ſight of their Army. They then carried on their Trenches towards the Bridge-Gate, and threw in a great quantity of Bombs, which Conſumed our Magazine of Forrage, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65930:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was laid up in a place which formerly had been a Church, belonging to the <hi>Recollects,</hi> whom my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law had Chas'd from thence, whilſt he was Governour of the place. I was hardly put to it to provide for our Horſes, which made me take all what I could meet with of Forrage in the Inns or Private Houſes: This and the fear of the Bombs, which had already ruin'd many Houſes, proved the occaſion of a Tumult among the Inhabitants, of whom I was fain to Impriſon ſome, to keep the reſt in awe. I took care to inform the Elector at Court of what had paſs'd, who ſent me word, that I ſhould Defend my ſelf to the laſt, they being reſolv'd to Relieve me in good time. Accordingly the Elector Marched to our Relief; of which <hi>Coningsmark</hi> had no ſooner notice, but he rais'd the Seige, after twelve days opening the Trenches. But before he March'd off, he Diſmantled the two Forts which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and the Elector who had notice given him of the raiſing of the Siege, returned to <hi>Berlin,</hi> the reſt of the Campaign being ſpent without any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Action. After the Campaign was over, I made my Appearance at Court to receive ſome Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from his Electoral Highneſs; and to give him an Account concerning what had paſs'd during the Siege of <hi>Altenoe.</hi> I was not forgetful to repreſent to him, That the <hi>Catholicks</hi> had ſhewn the greateſt Zeal for his Service in the Defence of the Place; whereas the others had been very remiſs in their Duties. I told him, that if he would be pleas'd to Annul what had been done by my Father-in-law when he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Place, and would Reſtore the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects</hi> the Church that was taken from them, this would be a means to encreaſe their Affection towards him, and to engage them for ever in his Intereſt. My perſwaſions prov'd ſo ſucceſsful, that the Elector did not only grant what I had deſired, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them the great Church, which my Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law had taken from them and given it to the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65930:50"/>I was extreamly well ſatisfy'd with what I had done in behalf of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> there, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced me infinitely more, was, that my Spouſe did aſſure me, ſhe found in her ſelf a great inclination to be Converted to our Faith. She was Educated in the ſame Religion her Father profeſs'd, who was the ſecond of that Family, ſince they turn'd <hi>Hereticks;</hi> her Grandfather and the whole Family having been always good Catholicks, till my Wifes Grandfather chang'd his Religion. This happy Inclination I could attribute to nothing elſe but a peculiar Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God; not but that I had often diſcours'd her upon this Subject, but it was a conſiderable time ago, having of late deſiſted from it, becauſe I found her not in the leaſt diſpoſed to hearken to my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this point. But her intended Converſion was likely to have prov'd almoſt Fatal to us both, becauſe I miſtook my choice in the Perſon to whoſe care I committed the management of it. For, I pitch'd upon a <hi>Jacobin</hi> Friar, who inſtead of being a Man of Virtue and Piety, as I thought him to have been, was for teaching my Spouſe quite another Leſſon than what I intended he ſhould do. She told me how he had managed his Buſineſs with her, which made me under hand give notice of his Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Superiour, without mentioning a word of it further, either to himſelf or any body elſe, for fear of bringing a Scandal upon our Religion. But my Spouſe took the thing quite otherwiſe, for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that all the reſt would prove like him, I found her quite averſe to purſue her former good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I had much ado to perſwad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> her, that the misbehaviour of a particular Perſon ought not to ſtain the Reputation of all others of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; That there had been a <hi>Judas</hi> among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves, and that therefore the reſt had been never the leſs Holy and Acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>This may ſerve as a warning to thoſe, who are entruſted with the care of ſending abroad Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries or other Perſons for the Converſion of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> to be ſure to chooſe ſuch as are of an untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65930:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Life; becauſe the leaſt Treſspaſs in them is apt to produce great Scandal, eſpecially if it be of the ſame Nature with this. At laſt my Wife being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by my perſwaſions, and the Inſtructions of a Religious Perſon, of a far different Temper from the <hi>Jacobin</hi> Friar, ſhe renounc'd <hi>Lutheraniſm,</hi> and was reconcil'd to that Church, which her Grandfather had abandon'd.</p>
               <p>We were now buſie in the Blockade of <hi>Stetin,</hi> all the Avenues of which were cloſely guarded by our Troops; notwithſtanding which, the <hi>Swedes</hi> found means to throw a Re-inforcement of 600 Men into the place, being guided by a Peaſant, who Conducted them croſs the Marſhes, through ways which were at another time quite Impaſſible. But notwithſtanding this, the Gariſon diminiſhed conſiderably every day, partly by Famine, partly by their frequent Sallies. The <hi>Swedes</hi> therefore made a ſecond Attempt to throw in another Re-inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the place; but the Elector's Troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better upon their guard, ſince the firſt Relief, moſt of them were made Priſoners before they could enter the Town: The Guide as ill Fortune would have it, was among theſe laſt, who had a Halter for his Reward. Our Elector kept alſo a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence in the place, by which means he hoped to make himſelf Maſter of it, without being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to employ his whole Force againſt it. The Chief of this Conſpiracy was a certain Brazier, of which there are a great many in that Town. It was agreed he ſhould ſet the Magazine of Amuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on Fire, which he did accordingly, together with one of the beſt Mills belonging to the Town, but being diſcovered, he with two more of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices were hang'd for their pains.</p>
               <p>The Beſieg'd who were very ſtrong within and headed by a Governour who perfectly well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Trade, made frequent Sallies upon us, in one of which they made themſelves Maſters of the Fort of <hi>Almea,</hi> where there was a Garriſon of 600 Men, who were all made Priſoners of War. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsmark</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65930:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
advanc'd likewiſe to the relief of the Place, but finding it impoſſible to raiſe the Blockade, he directed his March towards <hi>Altenoe;</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector fearing leſt he ſhould attempt a ſecond time the Siege of that place, ſent me thither with a rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of 600 Men. <hi>Coningsmark</hi> advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Town, by the way of the Bank, which leads along the River up to the two Forts, which he had built in the laſt Siege, without attempting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing further; his Buſineſs being only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Forage on that ſide, as he did afterwards for two Leagues round. For in two Months and more, whilſt he encamp'd thereabouts, he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruin and burn the Country, ſcarce leaving one Stone upon another; I being not in a poſture to prevent it. My Wife's Eſtate was involv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt in this Ruin, the Revenue of which, was ſettl'd by her Brother upon her Mother-in-law as a Jointure, which ſhe had enjoy'd quietly till now; but there being but little likelihood ſhe ſhould draw any thing of Moment from thence for ſome Years after, ſhe ſued me for her Jointure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence, that this being fallen away to nothing, I was oblig'd to aſſign her another Revenue in lieu of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it was in her power to chuſe which part ſhe pleas'd of my Brother-in-laws Eſtate.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Proviſions beginning to grow ſcarce in <hi>Stetin,</hi> the beſieg'd ſaw themſelves reduc'd to the utmoſt extremity. The <hi>Swedes</hi> made ſeveral attempts from without to open themſelves a Paſſage into the Town, whilſt the Beſieg'd endeavour'd to facilitate the Enterprize by a vigorous Sally upon our Trenches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had been open'd now againſt the place, the Elector having charg'd the Blockade, which ſeem'd too tedious to him, into a formal Siege. But tho' ſome of theſe Sallies were made with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs enough, and they ſeem'd reſolute to defend the place to the laſt, their Neceſſity increas'd more and more every day; ſo that having taken a reſolution to repreſent their miſerable condition to <hi>Coningsmark,</hi> a certain Cornet undertook the buſineſs. He came
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65930:51"/>
into our Camp, under pretence of having deſerted the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but there being ſeveral Troopers more of the ſame Regiment with him, who pretended to be deſerters at the ſame time, this created ſome ſuſpicion in the Elector; who thereupon threatn'd the Cornet to hang him forthwith, if he did not diſcover the whole truth of the matter. The fear of death extorted from him this Confeſſion, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the Beſieg'd were reduc'd to ſuch a deplorable Condition, as was impoſſible to be expreſs'd. The Elector, who almoſt began to deſpair of Succeſs, by reaſon of the approaching Winter, and who was upon the point of raiſing the Siege; being now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by this depoſition to continue it, did make it his chiefeſt care, to prevent <hi>Coningſmark</hi> from ſending any relief into the Place; and the <hi>Swediſh</hi> General being not in a condition to force his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, with that ſmall body of Troops he had with him, the City of <hi>Stetin,</hi> which would ſcarce have been taken by force, was neceſſitated to capitulate for want of Proviſions.</p>
               <p>The Law Suit I had with my Mother-in-law was extreamly vexatious to me, the more, becauſe I was advis'd, that in all likelihood it would go againſt me, which made me more deſirous than ever, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>France.</hi> I had alſo notice given me, that ſhe intended to attach a Summ of 100000 Livers, which belonged to my Wife, and was in the Bank of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> which made me take them from thence, and ſo transfer them to the Bank of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> till ſuch time I ſhould meet with an opportunity to put my Deſign in execution, which was, not to ſtay much longer in <hi>Germany.</hi> The chief reaſon, which made me firſt take this reſolution was, that the Electoral Prince continu'd ſtill to look upon me with a very ill Eye; and I was inform'd by credible Perſons, that he had let fall certain words, which gave me ſufficiently to underſtand, that in caſe the Elector ſhould happen to die, I ſhould certainly have all my Places taken away from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65930:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>So ſoon as the Peace was made, I pretended to have receiv'd News of my Father's Death, which made me ask leave of the Elector, to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>France.</hi> I had prevail'd with my wife to go along with me; but it was near ſix Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could get leave from the Elector; ſo that I did not ſet out from <hi>Altenoe,</hi> till towards the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year 1679. I took my Children (being five in all, two Boys and three Girls) along with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe no body ſhould gueſs at my real Intention, I told my Acquaintance that I had a mind to have them Educated in <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Sons in ſome College or other, and the Daughters in a Nunnery. I took the way of <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> where I drew my Money out of the Bank, which I put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of Mr. <hi>Gerard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gueverdin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Poelhoven,</hi> who gave me Bills of Exchange to the full value of it, upon Mr. <hi>Gouteure</hi> and Mr. <hi>Amonet</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> I ſhow'd my Wife all what was curious in <hi>Holland,</hi> and from thence purſu'd my Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> by the way of <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which I had a Mind ſhe ſhould alſo ſee.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was at <hi>Amſteldam,</hi> I paid a Viſit to Mr. <hi>Ramp,</hi> one of the greateſt Merchants of that City, with whom I was familiarly acquainted at that time, when our Regiment was in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Service. The firſt foundation of our Friendſhip was laid at <hi>Zwoll,</hi> where I happen'd to be Inſtrumental in a certain caſe, which was mighty pleaſing both to his Father and him. They were both very Zealous Catholicks, and by chance both at <hi>Zwoll,</hi> when this thing happen'd, of which I will give you the trueſt account I am able.</p>
               <p>You muſt know that in the Province of <hi>Over-Yſſel,</hi> the Exerciſe of the Catholick Religion is not ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow'd of, as in the Province of <hi>Holland.</hi> One Day when a certain Prieſt was ſaying Maſs in a place, where the <hi>Sehout</hi> (which is one of the chief Magiſtrates of the City) pretended it was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſo to do, without ſpecial leave from the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, he caus'd the Prieſt to be taken away from the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65930:52"/>
Altar, and without the leaſt reſpect to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Sacerdotal Habit, carried him away Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and ſeiz'd upon the holy Veſſel wherein the Hoſt was. I happen'd not to be in Town when this was done, being then at the <hi>Hague;</hi> but being after my return inform'd of the matter, it touch'd me to the very heart. I told the <hi>French</hi> Officers there in Garriſon, how they were able to brook ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, given both to God and their King, and that if they would follow me, we would ſoon deliver the Prieſt, and make the <hi>Sehout</hi> reſtore us the Holy Veſſel with the Hoſt, and let him know how he ſhould meddle with ſuch like things for the future. They having ſoon conſented to my Propoſition, we went to the <hi>Sehout</hi>'s Houſe, which we enter'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking leave, and gave him ſuch a Compliment, as did not much pleaſe him. We told him in ſhort, that we would cut his Throat, if he did not give us ſatisfaction immediately; that he had committed a groſs Error, which would never be approv'd of by the States General, whoſe intention was not that the Auxiliary Troops ſhould be debar'd from the free Exerciſe of their Religion; for I pretended to be one of them. He anſwer'd us, that he knew what he had done, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps we did not; that the Prieſt, whom he had made a Priſoner was a Native of that Country, and conſequently ſubject to their Laws; that if he had been a <hi>French</hi> Man, there might be ſome colour for what we did; but as he was not, he could not but wonder, that we ſhould intermeddle in a Buſineſs, which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us; it being undeniable, that there were at leaſt ten Inhabitants to one Soldier preſent at that time, when he diſturb'd this Prieſt in ſaying Maſs, which made it evident, that this was a politick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, which had not the leaſt relation to the Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Troops. But we told him, we were not to be put off with Words; and began to uſe ſuch Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to ruffle him, that he began to be afraid of his Life in good earneſt, unleſs he gave us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65930:53"/>In the mean while, it being rumour'd about the City, that the <hi>Sehout</hi>'s Houſe was forc'd by ſome Officers, who threatn'd to murther him, we ſaw the Houſe on a ſudden ſurrounded by the Populace, who were gather'd into ſeveral Bands, according to their different Religions, ſo that the whole City was in an uproar; and the Garriſon, who were all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> betook themſelves to their Arms, with an intention to diſperſe that Party that ſhould declare againſt us. The <hi>Sehout</hi> perceiving himſelf now in moſt imminent danger of his Life, began to be more pliable, and ſoon after diſcharg'd the Prieſt out of Priſon, unto whom he reſtor'd the Holy Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with the Hoſts, unto which we paid our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We deſir'd the Prieſt to look whether all the Hoſts were entire in the Veſſel, that if there wanted any, the <hi>Sehout</hi> ſhould pay with his Life for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege. The Prieſt looking into the Box, told us, that they were all there; tho' it be uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was really ſo, or whether he told us ſo to appeaſe our Anger, and to ſave the Life of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. The Matter being thus far compos'd to our ſatisfaction, we writ immediately to Monſieur <hi>d'Eſtrades,</hi> to give him notice of what had paſs'd; he receiv'd this Letter before the <hi>Sehout</hi> could inform the States of what had happen'd to him; for being Maſters of the Gates, we did not let any body paſs without leave. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, after he had perus'd our Letter, commended our Zeal, and made his Complaints to the States, about the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offer'd by the <hi>Sehout,</hi> to the Auxiliary Troops of his Majeſty. He told them that he was under an obligation to let the King his Maſter know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how the matter was tranſacted, unleſs they gave him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſatisfaction; that he knew the King to be ſo pious a Prince, as not to ſuffer ſuch a thing to be put upon him, let it coſt what it would. The States, who at that time ſtood in need of his Majeſty's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who had ſo lately aſſiſted them againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Munſter,</hi> deſir'd him not to write to the King, aſſuring him, that they would take ſuch Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65930:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as ſhould be ſatisfactory to him. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they depos'd the <hi>Sehout,</hi> without giving him leave to juſtifie himſelf, and declar'd him incapable of ſerving the Republick for the future.</p>
               <p>This was the occaſion of my acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Ramp,</hi> who, as he was a Man of ſingular Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo he ſhew'd as much ſatisfaction for the ſucceſs of this Buſineſs as my ſelf. As I was going to viſit him at his Country-Houſe, where he happen'd to be at that time. I paſs'd through <hi>Pardam,</hi> one of the largeſt and beſt Towns in <hi>North-Holland.</hi> A few days before my arrival there, they had taken ſome Coiners, among whom there was a <hi>Frenchman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> An Inhabitant of the Town, who was likewiſe a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>France,</hi> gave me an account of the matter, and told me among the reſt, how the poor <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had complain'd to him, that this was the firſt time he had committed this Crime, ſince he had been in this Country, which was near five Years; to which he had been droven by abſolute neceſſity. That he was born a Gentleman, and had been forc'd to leave <hi>France,</hi> becauſe he had fought a Duel. That he ſhew'd a great inclination to turn <hi>Catholick,</hi> but ſays he, I am afraid the fear of his approaching Deſtiny, will ſcarce give him time to think much of that. The advantageous Account he gave me of this unfortunate poor Fellow, mov'd me with Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which made me take up my Lodgings, in the ſame Inn, where he was detain'd Priſoner. I made his Waiter pretty Drunk, which gave me the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to talk to him, without being perceiv'd by them, and to ask him, whether there was no way left to ſave himſelf. He told me, that if he had ſome Ropes, he believ'd he could do it as he went to the Neceſſary Houſe, becauſe his Waiter us'd always to remain without; that the only danger he had to ſurmount was, that the Houſe of Office was built over a Canal, and that he could not ſwim. I anſwer'd him in two words, he ſhould take Courage, that he ſhould hear from me by to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, and I would endeavour to ſave his Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:65930:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>I left him thus, and went with all ſpeed to Mr. <hi>Ramp</hi>'s Houſe. The firſt thing I did there, was to ſpeak to Mr. <hi>Ramp</hi> about this unfortunate Perſon, how he was in a fair way of turning <hi>Catholick,</hi> if we could conſider of any way to ſave his Life. He was very well pleas'd with what I had propos'd to him; he provided ſome Ropes to be given him, and a Boat, which ſhould preſerve him from being drowned. Every thing being got in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we went from his Houſe to <hi>Pardam,</hi> where I went to ſee the Priſoner, gave him the Ropes, and inſtructed him further in every thing relating to his Eſcape. He had made them believe, purſuant to my Inſtructions, that he was ſeiz'd with a Vomiting and Looſeneſs that day, which as he pretended, continu'd ſome part of the Night; the better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Waiter, that he might not wonder at his long ſtay in the Houſe of Office. The appointed Hour being come, and finding the Boat ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in the Canal under the Hole, he let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down by the Rope. Thoſe appointed by Mr. <hi>Ramp</hi> for the management of the Buſineſs, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Boat to a place of ſafety, where he diſguis'd himſelf in Womens Cloaths, the better to ſecure his paſſage into <hi>France,</hi> whither he intended to go. He made at the ſame time a full abjuration of his Religion, in the preſence of a Prieſt of Mr. <hi>Ramp</hi>'s Acquaintance, who aſſiſted him with ſome Money, to defray the Charges of his Journey.</p>
               <p>But this was not the only Adventure that happen'd to me in this Country; for before I left it, I met with another, which made me tarry ſome days longer than I intended. Before I left <hi>Germany,</hi> I bought ſix fine Coach Mares, from Count <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> which coſt me 1000 Crowns. As I paſs'd by the <hi>Tothuis</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> to go to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> one of theſe Coach Mares, which was with the reſt put on board a Veſſel, being frightn'd by the noiſe of the Sails, threw her ſelf into the Water; I was vexed to the Heart, not ſo much for the loſs of my Money, as that the whole Set would be ſpoil'd; which made
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65930:54"/>
me engage two of the Seamen to follow with their Boat, promiſing each of them a Reward of a <hi>Lewis d'or,</hi> provided they could ſave her. Two of the Ships Crew undertook the Task, and took the Mare, but in lieu of bringing her to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they put her aſhoar in ſome place, which was out of our ſight; and then return'd to the Ship, pretending they had ſeen her drowned before their Eyes, before they were able to come near enough to ſave her. I did not in the leaſt miſtruſt them; and being come at Night into the Inn on the other ſide of the Water, (the River being about half a League over there) we went to Supper, in company with an unknown Perſon, who ſeem'd to be a Man of Faſhion. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both me and my Spouſe much diſcompos'd, he ask'd us the reaſon of it; and I frankly told him, that it was the loſs of my Coach Mare that troubl'd me. He ask'd me what kind of Mare ſhe was, and what Harneſs ſhe had? Having given him as exact a deſcription as I could of both, he told me, I need not vex my ſelf any further, for he was ſure ſhe was not drowned, as they had made me believe, and that he would put me in a way to have her again; that he had ſeen her with two Seamen, who would have ſold her to him: The next thing I ask'd him was, what kind of Fellows theſe Seamen were he ſpoke of, whom he deſcrib'd to me ſo exactly, and with ſo many Circumſtances, that I did not in the leaſt queſtion but they were the ſame, whom I had ſent after the Mare. Then I diſcover'd to him what my thoughts were concerning the matter, and advis'd with him, what way I had beſt to take to recover my Mare; we were both of the ſame opinion, to go to the Judges of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and to deſire that Juſtice might be done me upon this Account. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we croſs'd the Water next Morning early, and meeting with the two Seamen there, I told them, to avoid all ſuſpicion of their being diſcover'd, that I was come over the Water only to look for ſome Papers I had left at my Lodgings. I went to an Acquaintance of Mr. <hi>Gueverdin</hi>'s, living at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65930:55"/>
to whom I had Letters of recommendation from the ſaid Merchant.</p>
               <p>Having given him an exact Account of the whole matter, he went with me to a Magiſtrate of that City, to deſire him to grant us a Warrant for the Apprehending of theſe Rogues; but he refus'd to do it, alledging that it was againſt their Cuſtom to grant a Warrant without hearing firſt the Evidences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Gueverdin</hi>'s Friend repreſented to him that ſuch a delay would prove dangerous and chargeable to me, and that being a Stranger, they might in that reſpect diſpenſe with theſe Formalities: That I was ready to give caution for all Damages and Expences, in caſe I was found in the wrong of it. But this not being prevailing enough with the Judge, my Friend advis'd me to go ſtreight ways with him to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and to make our Applications to one of the Judges of a Superiour Court, whom he knew very well, and who would perhaps not be ſo ſcrupulous as the other; with this reſolution we went into the <hi>Shuit</hi> which was to carry us to <hi>Delft,</hi> where we found a Fellow ſmoaking Tobacco. The Maſter of the <hi>Shuit,</hi> told him, that if he would ſmoak he muſt do it without, not in the place where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſat; but the Fellow ridiculing the Maſter of the <hi>Shuit,</hi> he told him again that he ſhould not ſmoak any more there, it being contrary to their Orders, and if he would not believe him, he would ſhew them to him immediately. With that he went to his Trunk, and brought forth the Printed Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at which the other laugh'd, look'd juſt at them, and ſo threw them into the Water. In the mean while the Women made a great noiſe, telling the Maſter that they were choak'd up with the ſmoak of the Tobacco, which made the Maſter ſnatch the Pipe out of his Mouth, which he threw into the Canal, telling him, that ſuch Fellows who would not be ruil'd, muſt be thus ſerv'd. The ſmoaker to revenge himſelf, took a Knife out of his Pocket, and cut the Face of the Servant belonging to the <hi>Shuit,</hi> who had taken his Maſters part; This occaſion'd a great
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65930:55"/>
diſorder in the <hi>Shuit,</hi> which was with much ado ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd by the interceſſion of the Company. The wound at the ſame time happen'd not to prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, which made the Maſter appear careleſs in the matter; but he was no ſooner come to <hi>Delft,</hi> but he made his Complaints againſt the Fellow, who was ſeized immediately, and we being oblig'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as Witneſſes, it was ſome time before we could take Boat again for the <hi>Hague.</hi> I had not been many Hours there, when I happen'd to meet with the ſame Perſon with whom I had ſupp'd the night before, and who had given me the firſt account of my Mare. He went with us before the Judge, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further exception granted us the Warrant, which the Judge of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> had refus'd us. As we paſs'd through <hi>Delft</hi> in our return from the <hi>Hague,</hi> we were inform'd that the Magiſtrates of that City had taken a ſhort, but juſt way of proceding with the Fellow, who cut the Servants Cheek; whom they had Condemn'd to the <hi>Raſphuis,</hi> (a place where Vagabonds are employ'd in all manner of ſlaviſh work) which with them is look'd upon, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment equivalent to that of the Gallies in other Countries.</p>
               <p>After our return to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gueverden</hi>'s Friend ſoon procur'd me a ſufficient number of the <hi>Shuits</hi> Attendance, who marched along with us to the <hi>Tolhuis,</hi> where they ſeiz'd the two Sea-men, who were much ſurpris'd at this unexpected Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, eſpecially when they ſaw me come in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after. I upbraided them with their Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and what troubles they had put me to, ſo they gave me my Mare again, thinking to be acquitted thus of all Accounts, but I brought them in an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckoning, which they were forced to pay to the full at the <hi>Raſphuis;</hi> This may ſerve as an inſtance how exactly and impartially Juſtice is Adminiſtred in that Country, and of what conſequence it would be to us, if we would tread in their Footſteps, this being the only means to prevent many of theſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueries which are committed every day among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:65930:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>After I came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> I met with another Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho' of a different nature from this. Some <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> among whom indeed you may meet with as great Sharpers and Rogues as any are in <hi>France,</hi> had kept cloſe to me in my Journey, having got intelligence at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> by what means I know not, that I had good ſtore of ready caſh about me. One of them who had followed me at a little diſtance, ſeeing me engag'd in diſcourſe with a Friend of mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom I met accidentally in the Street, made up with my Wife, as ſhe was going along a little before me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accoſted her very civilly, pretending that he had a great reſpect for me; and being dreſs'd in a Grave <hi>Burghers</hi> Habit my Spouſe did ſuppoſe him to be one of my acquaintance. After I had overtaken her, the <hi>Dutch</hi> man who was ſtill talking with her, ſeem'd to be ſurpriz'd, and looking very ſtedfaſt upon me, told me, that he found himſelf under a miſtake; that he had really taken me for a certain perſon whoſe name he told me, which had made him take the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak to my Spouſe. His civil Behaviour and Diſcourſe engag'd me to give him a very obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Anſwer, whilſt we were walking along toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Street; and perceiving that we took our way towards the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> he ſaid he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd we intended to take a view of it, and that he ſhould be very glad to take the opportunity of our good Company to do the ſame. As I naturally have a kindneſs for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they being commonly a frank and eaſie temper'd people, ſo I return'd the Complement, telling him that we would take it for an Honour; and ask'd him at the ſame time, what place he was born in, and where he lodg'd at <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He told me that he was a Native of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and it happend that he nam'd he ſame Inn for his Lodgings, where we had taken up ours. As we were walking along we had variety of other diſcourſe, and among the reſt he told us with a very frank Air, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be natural to him, that he had been for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time under the Hatches, but that not long ago a Brother of his who had got together a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65930:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Eſtate in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> did happen to die, who left him wherewithal to live for the future like a Gentleman. After we had taken a view of the Caſtle, he pretended ſo much Ignorance as not to be able to find out the Inn again, for which purpoſe he feign'd to ask the way to it from a perſon who met us, unleſs, as he ſaid, I knew the way better than he. I told him that I believ'd I could find out the Street where the Inn was we were to lodge, and ſince he had taken his Lodgings up there as well as we, he need but follow us. All this Affected ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity was contriv'd on purpoſe to diſguiſe himſelf the better, in order to catch me with more eaſe in the ſnare. Thus we went on to our Inn, where we had not been long before Supper-time came; ſo my Wife and I came down out of our Chamber, into a very near Parlour where we found the Cloath ready laid, and to Supper we went in company with our Hoſt, a Prieſt, this <hi>Dutch</hi>-man, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country-men. The Prieſt went up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Chamber immediately after Supper, and the two <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſtay'd below in the Parlour with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſoon after one ask'd the other, whether he had a mind to play a Game at <hi>Berlan,</hi> whom the other anſwer'd, <hi>Done,</hi> and ſo to Cards they went, after they had ask'd me, whether I had a mind to play. I told them no, but that I would look on. So they began to play at ſmall Game. He, who had met us in the Street appear'd to be a great Bubble, for he ſhew'd his Cards ſo plainly, that he who plaid with him might ſee them as eaſily as my ſelf who ſat by. In a quarter of an hour or there abouts, the Game began to riſe very high, both of them draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abundance of Gold out of their Purſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he who accoſted us in the ſtreet had at leaſt a Thouſand Ducates in ſight before him, and as much Bubble as he appear'd to be, did win all the money from the other, except about a Dozen or Fourteen Ducates. I happen'd then to ſit near the loſer, for whom I ſhew'd ſome Compaſſion, juſt when the other delt him three Knaves and turn'd up the fourth. I paſs,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65930:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaid he, who had the Knaves in his hand; and he, who dealt, bidding upon the Game, the other laid four Ducates more; I hold you as much Gold as you have before you, anſwer'd the other again; Done ſaid the other, and I think I have got you now; you are under a miſtake, reply'd he who had dealt the Cards; I am only ſorry that there is no more Money upon the Board. I anſwer'd him, he might be glad there was no more, for he had certatnly loſt the Game; upon which he told me, that I was miſtaken, and if I would lay him ten Ducates of it, he'd ſoon convince me to the contrary. I ſaid, Done, and each of us having ſtak'd our ten Ducates, he ſhew'd his Cards, and that he had three Kings; but the other at the ſame time diſcovering his three Knaves, he was forced to confeſs that he had loſt. After they had dealt two or three times more, they invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to make one with them, to give ſatisfaction to the other for what he loſt to me; but as I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a lover of Cards, or indeed of any other Game, I told them I would not play, but that before we parted, ſome opportunity or other would offer to hold him again, which I would be ſure to do, to give him a fair chance for the recovery of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. He made me no anſwer at all, ſeeming to be very indifferent in the matter; and I had the good Fortune to win about fourteen Ducates more of him, the other near whom I ſat, giving me the ſignal when he had good Cards, in hopes to draw me in for a good round Sum, by the gain of them.</p>
               <p>I ſtay'd with them till it was pretty late, when I left them at play and to Bed I went. I had told them before in what Inn I was to be at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> ſo they follow'd me thither, and took up their Quarters in the ſame Inn, knowing that I was to ſtay for ſome time at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> they did not ſpeak the leaſt word of Gaming the firſt day, but the next they began their old trade, and did all what they could to entice me to play, or at leaſt to lay my Money with them. But having buſineſs of much greater conſequence to do at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> I had no time to ſpend much
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65930:57"/>
with them. When they found me getting every thing in readineſs to purſue my Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> they brought two more of their Gang along with them into the Inn; and after ſome indifferent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, one of them ask'd me, whether I was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to leave <hi>Bruſſels?</hi> Unto which I having made anſwer, In a day or two at fartheſt; they told me in a ſort of a threatning way, That it was not fair to deal thus with honeſt Gentlemen; that when a Man had won anothers Money, he was oblig'd to give him ſatisfaction; and to part with a Gentleman, without giving him a fair chance to recover his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, look'd more like a Sharper than a Gentleman. This Compliment gave me to underſtand, in what Company I had been all this while, which indeed, I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of before; ſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with my ſelf, that in point of prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ought not to engage with four Pick-pockets at once, I very civilly anſwer'd them, That I was ſorry I ſhould be buſie all that day long, but that at night after Supper, I would be ready to do what they thought convenient. They were ſo weak as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me to be in earneſt, and ſo left me. But the firſt thing I did, was to pay a Viſit to the Marquiſs <hi>de Ville,</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and my Acquaintance. I gave him an exact relation in what manner I had been likely to have been dealt withal by theſe Fellows, deſiring his aſſiſtance. He told me, I muſt have them taken up, and if I pleas'd he would ſend me ſome of his Guards. It was then agreed betwixt us, that eight of them, ſhould one after another, at ſeveral Intervals come to enquire for me at the Inn, whom I ſhould take care to hide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Hangings, and in ſome Cloſets, that were in a certain Anti-Chamber next to my Lodging Room, where they might over hear us, and at a Signal given, be ready to ſeize them. This being done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when Supper-time drew near, I told the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs, that my Wife being ſomewhat indiſpos'd to night, we intended to Sup in our Bed-Chamber; and the four Sharpers were no ſooner advertis'd of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65930:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it, but they came up boldly to me, and began to tell me in very groſs Terms, that they ſaw I took this for a pretext not to perform my promiſe, and other ſuch like Expreſſions. Thoſe of the Guards, who heard every word they ſaid, ſallied thereupon forth out of their Ambuſh, ſeiz'd them all four, and ſo carried them to Priſon. Next day they made their applications to me, In hopes that they might be diſcharg'd with asking my Pardon; but the Marqueſs <hi>de Ville</hi> would have them puniſh'd, which indeed he did; for they were forc'd to pay a good Fine, and return all what they had got out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, to the right Owners.</p>
               <p>Thus being rid of my Company, I purſu'd my Journey to <hi>Paris.</hi> As I paſs'd through <hi>Peronne,</hi> the Farmers of the Cuſtoms, or rather their Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſtop'd my Coach, pretending that I had ſome prohibited Commodities there. I declar'd to them I had none; but they anſwer'd me poſitively, they knew the contrary; and ſince I was not in an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to make a ſincere Confeſſion, they would take care to find them out themſelves: So they would have made me alight, till they could ſearch all over the Coach, which I refus'd to do, telling them, they might go along with me to the Inn, where they ſhould ſearch as long as they pleas'd. But theſe Brutes not being ſatisfi'd with this, I began to be a little rough with them, which made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver (or Surveyor) come forth out of his Office, and having underſtood what was the occaſion of our Difference, he order'd them to follow me to the Inn, and to do their Duty there. After we were come to the Inn, they ſearch'd us all over one after another, not excepting the Child it ſelf, which they made the Maid unſwath below in the Yard.</p>
               <p>I was not able to brook ſo much rudeneſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them ſome harſh words; and I order'd my Wife's Chambermaid, who always tended that Child, (my Wife being, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>German</hi> Ladies, Nurſe herſelf) to carry them up Stairs, and to open before their Faces, a Basket
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65930:58"/>
with Linnen and other things belonging to the Child, this being the only thing they had not ſeen as yet. Two of the Cuſtom-houſe Officers, went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly up Stairs after her; where, when the Maid had open'd the Basket, one of them more eager than the other in the performance of his Office, put his Hand into the Basket, and as ill chance would have it, happen'd to light upon a ſhitten Clout, which made him draw back his Hand as faſt as he could, but ſo bedaub'd and tainted with ſo odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Smell, that his Companion could not forbear to burſt out into laughter. The other being vex'd to the Soul to ſee himſelf thus ridicul'd, clapt his Hand into his Companion's Face, which put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Fury, that he drew his Sword and run him through the Body, ſo that he fell inſtantly dead upon the Floor. The Chamber-maid ſeeing what paſs'd betwixt them, was ſo frightn'd at it, that ſhe threw the Child on the Bed, and before ſhe could get out of the Room fell into a Swoon, which gave opportunity to him, who had committed the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to eſcape undiſcover'd.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this happen'd above Stairs, I was in the Stable, to ſee that my Horſes were well order'd after their Journey; my Wife being conducted by one of the Servants belonging to the Inn, into a Parlour below. Two other Cuſtom-Houſe Officers, had in the mean while been taken up with ſearching all Corners of my Coach, where they would needs find out ſome Points and Hair; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſome days before, receiv'd certain Information from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that a good quantity of theſe Goods had been hid betwixt the roof of a Coach, drawn by Six Gray Horſes, in order to be ſecretly convey'd into <hi>France.</hi> My Coach and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Horſes agreeing in all reſpects with what had been told them, they were fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this muſt be the Coach, which made them be ſo eager in their Search.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time my Spouſe began to enquire what was become of the little Child, whether it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65930:59"/>
was carried up Stairs, and whether they had light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fire for it; and the Servant of the Houſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told her, ſhe believ'd it was above in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but that no Fire was made for it as yet; ſhe bid her take a Faggot, and ſhew her the Room where the Child was. I leave it to every body to judge, how great muſt be their ſurprize, when they ſaw the Cuſtom-Houſe Officer lying upon the Floor, and wallowing in his own Blood, and the Chamber-Maid in a Swoon. My Spouſe, who thought no otherwiſe than that ſhe was dead, call'd to me out of the Window, whilſt the Servant cry'd out Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being ſo much frightned, that ſhe ſcarce knew what ſhe did or ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of the Houſe being alarm'd at theſe Outcries, order'd the Gates of the Inn to be ſhut up, till ſuch time he could ſend for the Civil Officers. For my part I was put into the greateſt conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could be, fearing, not without reaſon, that I might fall under the ſuſpicion of having Murther'd the Fellow, becauſe I had us'd ſome hard expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before. It was not long before the Civil Officers, at the Head of whom was the Surveyour of the Cuſtom-Houſe, appear'd in the Inn, who laid hold of me, and would have carried me to Priſon, if the Judge would have conſented to it: He examin'd both me and the Hoſtler, who declar'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ever ſince I came into the Inn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had been in the Stables, near my Horſes, and that I had not been above Stairs at all. The next who were examin'd, were my Wife and my eldeſt Son, who was then about nine Years of Age; but as they were quite igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the matter, they could not give the leaſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Queſtions propos'd to them by the Judge. The Chamber Maid was the only Perſon who could give a full account of the whole, who by this time was recover'd from her Swoon, by the application of proper Remedies; but the difficulty was, that ſhe not underſtanding a word of <hi>French,</hi> and all the reſt nothing of the <hi>German</hi> Language, they were as much at a ſtand as before. I then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65930:59"/>
propos'd to the Judge to let me ſee her, and that I would explain to him word by word what ſhe ſhould declare concerning the matter. The Judge willingly agreed to what I had propoſ'd, with this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I ſhould ſet down in writing both the queſtions I ſhould ask her, and her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. Accordingly the Chamber-maid having given me an exact Relation of the whole matter, as I have related it before, both the Judge and I were fully ſatisfied how the thing had happen'd; but being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd by his Office not to paſs over any Formalities required by the Law in ſuch a Caſe, I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were confin'd cloſe Priſoners in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inn for three Days. In the mean while he ſent to <hi>Cambray</hi> for one who underſtood the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, and was to ſerve as an Interpreter of the Depoſitions to be made by my Spouſe's Chamber-maid, by my Coach-man, Poſtilion, and Footman, who were likewiſe all three <hi>Germans.</hi> The Judge was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable as to recommend me to a Counſellour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who told me, that I ſhould not trouble my ſelf any further, being aſſur'd that the Surveyor of the Cuſtom-Houſe, ſhould be forc'd to repay me all my Expences.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the Interpreter was Arriv'd from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> the Judge proceeded in the further examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the before mention'd Witneſſes; but the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor had in the mean while been ſo over-haſty in the Proſecution of the buſineſs that he had given ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it immediately to the Farmer General, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter had been throughly unravell'd; he had alſo taken Copy's of my Bills of Exchange which the Judge had cauſed to be laid by in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Rolls Office. The Farmer General be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving there was ſomething to be got for them, ſent him full power to proſecute me to the utmoſt, and attach'd the ſaid Bills in the hands of the Bankers at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon whom they were drawn. But it was not long before the Surveyor had occaſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to repent himſelf of having acted with ſo much precipitation. For having underſtood that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65930:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Chamber-maid perſiſted in Accuſing one of his Officers of the Murther, and that he had never appear'd ſince, he diſpatch'd another Meſſenger to <hi>Paris,</hi> to give a more ample and true account of the matter, which was not ſo pleaſing to them as the firſt. He ſent in queſt of the Fellow, who was at laſt found to have ſav'd himſelf in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. This being a convincing Proof of his Guilt and my Innocence, the Surveyor now began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider which way to draw his head out of the Snare he was catch'd in by his own Imprudence, the more becauſe the Head Farmers being inform'd of his raſh procedures, had not only ſent him a ſevere Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but alſo had recall'd their full Power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute me. This made him cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> offering to lay down the Cudgels, and to reimburſe me all my Charges. My Lawyer advis'd me not to accept of it unleſs he would alſo allow for Damages and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; but conſidering the Troubles that always attend Law-ſuits, eſpecially in a Strange place; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his offer, under condition that I ſhould by due Courſe of Law be diſcharged from the ſaid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, which being done accordingly, I had all my Charges paid me by the Surveyor, and ſo left this City.</p>
               <p>Theſe Adventures and diſappointments had how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſo ſtrong an Influence over my Spouſe that ſhe began to be much diſcontented, and to repent that ſhe had left her Native Country, which was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably augmented by another Misfortune, which touch'd us both more ſenſibly than any before. For my Eldeſt Son, who hitherto had been as healthy a Child as ever was ſeen, was whilſt we were at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> ſeiz'd with a ſtrange kind of Diſtemper, the like ſcarce ever had been heard of before, of which he linger'd for near ſix Months together, to wit, till the next following Chriſtmas, when he died. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it happen'd thus; As he was walking with me one day along the Streets, he did run all on a ſudden away from me, as faſt as his heels could carry him, till at laſt he ran with ſuch a violence againſt one that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65930:60"/>
met him accidentally, that he was thrown down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Senſe or Motion. We endeavour'd by all means poſſible to recover him out of his ſleep, but to no purpoſe, ſo that we were forced to have him carried to one of the next Houſes, where being laid upon a Bed, he awaken'd after two Hours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd all his Senſes, but had not the leaſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance left of what had paſs'd. This diſtemper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued upon him till his death, and that without the leaſt alteration; ſo that if the River had been in his way, he would infallibly have thrown himſelf into it, and ſometimes it would return once in eight, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times once in fourteen days. Whilſt I was at <hi>Paris</hi> I conſulted ſome of the Faculty there concerning the nature of his Diſtemper, and what remedies might be applied againſt it. I had at the firſt beginning conſulted likewiſe ſome of the Phyſicians at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who told me, that they believ'd it to be a kind of an <hi>Epilepſie;</hi> but the Phyſicians of <hi>Paris</hi> were of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Opinion, aſſuring me that thoſe of <hi>Antwerp</hi> had been miſtaken in their judgment: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they were ſo puzzl'd about it themſelves, that they could never agree poſitively either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the Diſtemper, or its proper Remedies. In the mean while I was forc'd to keep always one near him to watch all his Motions, for fear of ſome ſiniſter accident, and thus I continued to do as long as he liv'd.</p>
               <p>If it be permitted to us Mortals to dive into the hidden cauſes of God's Judgments, who ſometimes Afflicts the Innocent with the Guilty, tho' juſtly, and without giving us the leaſt occaſion of grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt his Divine Providence; I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this as well as ſeveral other Afflictions which befell me about the ſame time, did proceed from an Error I had committed againſt his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then, that when I bought the before-mentioned Set of ſix Coach Mares from Count <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> he was ſo ſincere to tell me, juſt when we were ſtriking up the bargain, that if I was of a ſcrupulous Conſcience, I ought
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65930:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to take notice that among the ſix Mares there was one which perhaps I would not care to meddle with, becauſe that ſhe was dreſs'd frequently by an Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblin, and that there were ſome People, who look'd upon theſe Horſes to be very unfortunate to the Owners. But I having taken a particular fancy to the Mare, and being not very Religious at that time, I laugh'd at it, and took the Mare without any further conſideration, thinking the Count had been in jeſt with me. However I was ſoon undeceiv'd as to the laſt, for tho' the Grooms never touch'd her, ſhe appear'd always more ſlick and better dreſs'd than any of the reſt. And I can affirm it for Truth, that for fifteen or ſixteen Months together, whilſt ſhe was in my Poſſeſſion, it happen'd every five and Twentieth day of the Month that the Hobgoblin took off her Shooes of all her four Feet, as well as any Smith cou'd have done, and dreſs'd her all over to the greateſt nicety, unleſs it were her Tail which he left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd.</p>
               <p>My Spouſe was perſwading me almoſt every day to part with this Mare, but being the fineſt of the whole Set, I could not reſolve upon it for a Conſiderable time; till at laſt, finding that ſhe would not go in the Coach if ſhe ſaw the Mare among the reſt. I match'd her with one of the others, and ſo gave her in keeping to a certain Inn-keeper of <hi>Samur</hi> at the Sign of the Three-Black-Moors-Heads, with orders to ſell them for me, with the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. The Maſter's name of this Inn was <hi>Giteau,</hi> where abundance of Perſons of Quality lodg'd; when I told him what I knew concerning the Hobgoblin, he look'd upon it as a <hi>Rhodomantado,</hi> his real opinion being that I parted with them for no other reaſon, but becauſe they had ſome remarkable defect, which I intended to hide under this pretext. But as he kept them two whole Months in his cuſtody, ſo he was an Eye-witneſs of what I had told him before. At laſt they were Sold to the Marqueſs <hi>de la Tremblaie Robin,</hi> a Gentleman of the Province of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who paid me a Hundred <hi>Lewis d'or's</hi> for them. Ever
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65930:61"/>
ſince he has had them the Hobgoblin has never fail'd to attend the Mare in the ſame manner as he did before, and I believe the Gentleman keeps them both to this day, at leaſt he had not parted with them the laſt Year, which was the Year 1694. They were then Eighteen Years old, and he told me ſincerely, that notwithſtanding their age, he would not part with them for two of the beſt Coach Horſes in the whole Province.</p>
               <p>I was willing to give you an account of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a thing, before I proceeded any further in giving you a Relation of what happen'd to me after my arrival in <hi>Paris,</hi> till I ſettled at <hi>Samur.</hi> For beſides that I ſhall ſoon purſue the Thread of my former Relation; I was of opinion I ought not to paſs by in ſilence ſo extraordinary an Adventure, which as it often makes a great noiſe in the World, yet are the Learned ſo divided about it in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that many believe nothing at all of it. It was I ſay, partly upon this Score, that I was willing to relate what I have been an Eye-witneſs of in this kind to convince ſome incredulous People, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Atheiſts of this Truth; <hi>That there are Spirits.</hi> For, what elſe but a Spirit could do ſuch a thing? And <hi>that</hi> conſequently <hi>there is a God,</hi> with whoſe permiſſion theſe things are done, as being the Supream Ruler of theſe Spirits.</p>
               <p>But to return where we left off before. I told you that the Head Farmers had attach'd my Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, ſo that when I came to demand the payment of from my Bankers at <hi>Paris,</hi> they told me they could not ſafely pay them till the attachment were taken off, which I had neglected to take care of, before I left <hi>Samur.</hi> Thus I found my ſelf under a neceſſity of making my Application to the Farmers Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and was fain to attend ſeveral times at their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice before I could obtain a Diſcharge for theſe Bills, which could not be done but at a full Meeting; which detain'd me ſeveral days longer at <hi>Paris</hi> than at firſt I intended. But a new accident, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to my Spouſe's Chamber-maid, prov'd the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65930:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a new delay in my Journey, when I was juſt ready to leave the City. I lodg'd in an Inn in St. <hi>Denys</hi>-ſtreet, at the ſign of the Iron Croſs; and fearing that my Wife's Chamber-Maid, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not one word of <hi>French,</hi> might miſtake her way, if ſhe ſhould go abroad without a Guide, I deſir'd the Cook-maid of the Inn, one <hi>Sunday,</hi> to go with her to Maſs, and to reconduct her home: But the Cook-maid, inſtead of being careful in what ſhe had promis'd to do, left the Chamber-Maid in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church in the <hi>Butchers-ſtreet,</hi> making only a ſign to her, that ſhe ſhould expect her return there. The Chamber-Maid, who underſtood her meaning, ſtay'd for her accordingly in the Church, without the leaſt uneaſineſs; but hearing the Clock ſtrike nine, and being afraid to be chid by her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, if ſhe ſhould ſtay longer, ventur'd to try to find the way home alone, tho' ſhe did not know which way to turn; ſhe ask'd ſeveral People the way to the Iron Croſs, but not underſtanding what ſhe meant, no body could direct her.</p>
               <p>A Woman who had obſerv'd her at ſome diſtance, approach'd her at laſt, making a ſign to follow her, in order as ſhe believ'd, to conduct her to the Inn. With this intention ſhe follow'd her pretended Guide, whom ſhe ſaw knock at a Door, at the ſign of the Sciſſors, but ſeeing this was not the place ſhe look'd for, ſhe kept at ſome diſtance from the Houſe. The Woman perceiving ſhe was afraid to venture into the Houſe, made her a ſign to ſtay a little, till ſhe could come again; and ſo up one pair of Stairs ſhe went, and return'd immediately with a <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman which lodg'd in her Houſe. This <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman ask'd the Chamber-Maid what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-woman ſhe was, and what ſhe wanted? deſiring her to come juſt up Stairs, and to tarry a moment, till ſuch time, that the Woman who had conducted her hither, could diſpatch ſome little neceſſary Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when ſhe would be ready to ſhew her the Inn ſhe enquir'd after. They had much ado to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another, there being a remarkable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65930:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
betwixt the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongues. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as there are many words which have a great relation to one another in both, and the main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conſiſts in the pronunciation; our Chamber-Maid could eaſily gueſs at their meaning, and was at laſt prevail'd upon to go with them up Stairs. The firſt thing they did after they had got her in, was to conduct her into a handſome Appartment back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, where they entertain'd her with a good Breakfaſt; beſides which, they ply'd her ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Strong-Waters and other ſorts of Liquors, which ſoon ſeiz'd the Brains, that the Gentlewoman began to forget whither ſhe was bound; and thus continuing to let the Cup go about briskly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>German</hi> faſhion, it was not long before ſhe found her ſelf to ſtand in need of ſome Repoſe, to diſperſe the Vapours ariſing from the Strong-Liquors ſhe had taken.</p>
               <p>The Chamber-Maid was beholding for this good Chear, not ſo much to the good inclinations of her new Landlady, as to her own Beauty; for it ſeems her Profeſſion was to debauch young Wenches, and to diſpoſe of them to ſuch as would pay her a good round Summ. Accordingly this young Woman was no ſooner laid in Bed, but away ſhe went to a certain Abbot, who was a good Cuſtomer of hers, (whom, out of a motive of Charity, I will forbear to name at this time) whom ſhe told, that ſhe had a rare Purchaſe for him, a delicate handſom young Woman, who would fit his Appetite. She told him without queſtion, by what chance ſhe was fallen into her Hands, and that he ought to make uſe of his good Fortune, which did not preſent at all times. But whatever her Perſwaſions may have been, they were ſo prevailing upon the Monſieur <hi>L'Abbè,</hi> that he was at the Houſe as ſoon as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They found a handſome Dinner prepar'd for them, and the whole Company din'd together, who all drank briskly to the <hi>German,</hi> the better to diſpoſe her to take the Bait they intended to give her. The Abbot was indeed very careful on his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65930:63"/>
ſide, not to give the leaſt ſuſpicion of his deſign; nevertheleſs the Chamber-Maid, whether ſhe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted her Landlady, or that ſhe was aſham'd to drink ſo much again, could not be prevail'd upon to drink to any exceſs. After Dinner was over, the Woman of the Houſe, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman and the Abbot went out of the Room: But it was not long before the laſt return'd alone, and made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the fair <hi>German,</hi> whom at laſt he attempted to Raviſh.</p>
               <p>It is a very hard matter for me to tell you the whole truth of what paſs'd there; for tho' the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Maid herſelf upon examination, ſtood it out to the laſt, that he had not debauch'd her; there were others who affirm'd the contrary; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman declar'd in her Depoſitions, that ſhe had not only lain with the Abbot, but with two others afterwards, the Landlady having diſpos'd of her Maidenhead three ſeveral times. In the mean while, we were in a peck of troubles about the long ſtay of our Maid; all the anſwer we could get from the Cook-Maid, who was to have been her Guide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe did not find her in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church in the Butcher's Street, where ſhe had made her a ſign to ſtay for her return. Thus we continu'd for ſix days together, without hearing one word of her, which made us give her over for loſt. To confeſs the truth, I for my part, could not think her to be altogether ſo innocent as ſhe would make herſelf; becauſe the next following <hi>Saturday</hi> after ſhe was loſt, the Hoſtler of our Inn happen'd to paſs by the Houſe, where ſhe was lying in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; ſhe call'd out pretty loud to him in our <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Tone, <hi>Munſour, Munſour,</hi> which made him look up that way, from whence he had perceiv'd the Voice to come, but could ſee nothing but her Forehead, becauſe her Landlady perceiving her to call to ſomebody, catch'd her about the Middle, and ſnatch'd her away from the Window.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, this prov'd the real occaſion of her diſcovery; for the Hoſtler was no ſooner come back
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65930:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the Inn, but he told my Coachman what he had heard and ſeen, and that he believ'd it was the voice of my Spouſe's Chamber-Maid. The Coachman having related to me what he had heard from the Hoſtler, I enquir'd of him the name of the Street, and what Sign it was at; which I was no ſooner inform'd of, but I ſent abroad a certain Perſon, to ſpie out what ſort of People they were that liv'd at the Houſe he had told me, being willing to have a more certain foundation to go upon than the Hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's word, before I would make any noiſe of the matter. It is to be obſerv'd, that this Woman did not keep a publick Bawdy-Houſe, as innumerable others do at <hi>Paris;</hi> but ſhe carried on her Trade with a great deal of cunning and ſecrecy, and her Reputation was ſo well eſtabliſh'd among her Neighbourhood, that there was not one who would give her an ill word, all that we were able to learn being no more than this: That there Lodg'd a young <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman at her Houſe; That indeed, ſome few Men were ſeen ſometimes to go thither, but that they went for her Husband's Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for ſhe had one who carried himſelf ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly in all outward appearance among his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that both he and ſhe liv'd in very good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
               <p>But, as ill Fortune would have it, a Cobler kept his Stall juſt over againſt the Houſe, who indeed gave them a very good Character, as well as the reſt, but withal told our Spie, that there was a certain foreign Woman in the Houſe, whoſe Shooes he had mended within two days before; and being ask'd what kind of Woman ſhe was, he gave ſuch, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act deſcription of her, that when I heard of it, I did not any further queſtion, but that it was the ſame Perſon we wanted. I had before conſulted with Mr. <hi>de Gouteux,</hi> one of the Bankers, upon whom I had a Bill of Exchange, concerning what was beſt to be done in the matter, and it was he, who had recommended me the Perſon, who ſerv'd us as a Spy to diſcover them. I gave him therefore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65930:64"/>
an account of what reaſon we had to ſuſpect this Houſe, and he agreeing with me in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he went the next morning with me to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, who was of his Acquaintance, to go along with me to ſearch the Houſe. We came thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine a Clock, and going up ſtreightways the firſt pair of Stairs, we knock'd at the Door; but in lieu of opening the Doors, they told us through the Key-hole, that the Miſtriſs of the Houſe was gone abroad, and had double lock'd the Doors.</p>
               <p>Becauſe we would enter the Houſe without cauſing any ſuſpicion, the Commiſſary had order'd his Clerk to carry his Gown, which he did not put on till we were upon the Stairs; ſo that we got up without being perceiv'd by any body. The Woman of the Houſe returning in the mean while, and finding every thing quiet about the Houſe, (which elſe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens upon ſuch like occaſions) did not in the leaſt miſtruſt the matter, and ſo ſtreight up Stairs ſhe came to the very Chamber-door; but ſo ſoon as ſhe caſt her Eyes upon us, ſhe chang'd colour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to ſpeak one word. The Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry looking upon it as a certain mark of guilt, ask'd her without any further words for the Key. At the ſame time the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman hearing the noiſe without, ſpoke to one another, ſo as to be overheard by us; nevertheleſs, being ſtill in ſome uncertainty, whether this was the Voice of her I look'd for, or not, I call'd her by her Name, and ask'd her in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, whether it was ſhe or not. She anſwer'd me immediately <hi>ja Her,</hi> which is as much as, Yes, Maſter; ſo that the thing being now beyond all queſtion, the Commiſſary gave the ſignal to his Clerk, to fetch his Emiſſaries, who lay conceal'd in a neighbouring Alley. The Woman at firſt refus'd to deliver the Key, under pretence that ſhe had forgot it, in the place from whence ſhe came laſt, offering at the ſame time to go and fetch it. But ſeeing the Emiſſaries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and that the Commiſſary order'd his Clerk to go and fetch a Lock-ſmith to pick the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65930:64"/>
Lock, ſhe threw her ſelf at his Feet and deliver'd the Key.</p>
               <p>After we were enter'd the Room, the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry examin'd the Chamber-maid, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Woman, a young Wench of about fifteen Years of Age, and the Woman of the Houſe, each of them ſeparately, having before order'd his Followers to take care, they ſhould not ſpeak to one another. I ſupply'd the place of an Interpreter to my Wife's Chamber-Maid, from whom, and what was depos'd by the reſt, I learn'd the whole matter, as I have related it juſt now. They were all carried to Priſon except my Wife's Chamber-Maid; and the Commiſſary would likewiſe have ſeiz'd upon the Furniture of the Houſe, which indeed was none of the worſt, if the Landlord, under pretence of ſome Rent due to him, had not prevented it; ſo a Guard was ſet in the Houſe, as it is uſual upon ſuch like occaſions.</p>
               <p>After our Chamber-Maid was got with us in the Inn again, and had given us an exact account of the whole matter, Mr. <hi>Gouteux,</hi> whoſe adviſe I took in every thing before, was of opinion to lay an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Abbot, whom he knew to be very Rich, and that he would rather part with ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, than expoſe himſelf in a Law Suit of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His advice being look'd upon as very feiſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we reſolv'd to follow it, and thus I enter'd my Action againſt him in the Chamber-Maid's Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was ſo alarm'd at it, that he immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd one Mr. <hi>Van Gangel,</hi> another Banker of <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Gouteux</hi> to interceed with me, not to proceed any further againſt him. Mr. <hi>Van Gangel</hi> offer'd likewiſe a ſmall Preſent, in hopes the Chamber-Maid would take it in lieu of Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but I would not let her accept his Offer. After ſeveral Interviews, I was at laſt prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to accept of a hundred <hi>Lewis dor's</hi> for her uſe, whereas, if we had ſtood it out to the laſt, I believe we might have had a much greater Summ.</p>
               <p>Before this laſt Adventure happen'd to us, I went to pay a Viſit to Madam <hi>Sanguin</hi> (whom I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65930:65"/>
before) to know from her whether my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were as yet living, and what was become of my Siſter. I went thither in my Coach, and I may ſay it without Vanity, that there are not two finer Coach Horſes in all <hi>Paris,</hi> than thoſe two I had at that time in the Coach. Her Porter had liv'd with the old Mr. <hi>de Bordeaux,</hi> and had ſeen me there a thouſand times; nevertheleſs, when my Footman told him my Name, he did not in the leaſt think it was I, being prepoſſeſs'd with the opinion, that I was no more among the living. I call'd to him my ſelf to come nearer to the Coach, which when he had done, and heard me ſpeak, he was in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſurpriſe in the World, to find it was my ſelf, having forgot my Phyſiognomy by reaſon of my long abſence, tho' the Wound which I had receiv'd in the Face at the Battle of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> made me very remarkable.</p>
               <p>But Madam <hi>Sanguin</hi> herſelf was more ſurpriz'd than her Porter, and told my Footman who ſpoke to her, that it could not be, becauſe I had been dead many Years ago; and when I approach'd her, I found her as much amaz'd, as if my Ghoſt had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to her. She ask'd me three or four times, whether it were poſſible that it was I, and whether it was I indeed? After I had given her reiterated aſſurances that it was I indeed, ſhe then told me, that it was not my long abſence alone, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more real, which had occaſion'd her ſurprize to ſee me alive. She then told me, how my Siſter having taken a reſolution to Marry, did not only give it out, that about two Years after my departure out of <hi>France,</hi> I had been beheaded at <hi>Metz</hi> for Coining, but that alſo, to confirm the truth of it, ſhe had produc'd a Certificate ſign'd by four Soldiers, who pretending to have belong'd to the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, had teſtifi'd the whole truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſhe had caus'd to be Regiſter'd in due form.</p>
               <p>I having formerly had ſo many proofs of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious inclinations of my Siſter, was not much
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65930:65"/>
ſurpriz'd at what <hi>Madam Sanguin</hi> told me: and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd her at the ſame time, to give me a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what was become of her ſince. She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me, that ſoon after, ſhe had got ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant over my Father, who was very old, that ſhe perſwaded him to ſell his Eſtate, which he had actually done to one Mr. <hi>Barriar,</hi> who paid him 28000 Livers for it; that ſhe had put the greateſt part of it out upon Bonds, under her Name, and the reſt ſhe had brought up with her to <hi>Paris,</hi> in hopes to catch ſome body or other; that ſhe had plaid the part of a Lady of Quality there ſo long, till all her ready Money being ſpent, ſhe had been forc'd to diſpoſe of all her Bonds, except one of 14000 Livers, due to her from the Baron <hi>d'Aunais,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi> near <hi>Alenſon;</hi> that ſhe had endeavour'd to diſpoſe of that likewiſe, but could not meet with a Purchaſer, becauſe the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's Affairs were look'd upon to be but in an ill poſture. That the Baron dy'd ſoon after, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Debts than Effects to pay them, ſhe had loſt her 14000 Livers; that my Father, who had liv'd of late near <hi>Alenſon,</hi> had ſpent what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining by degrees, and had left ſo little now, as to be reduc'd to a degree of Poverty.</p>
               <p>Theſe were very unwelcome Tydings to me; and to add to my Affliction, I was alſo inform'd that my Brother by the Mother's ſide, had conſum'd his Eſtate of about 300 pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> which made me alter my reſolution of ſetling my ſelf in that Country. <hi>Madam Sanguin</hi> having given me a relation of the preſent condition of my Family, ſhe was very deſirous to underſtand from my own Mouth, what Fortune had attended me, ſince my departure out of <hi>France.</hi> I told her among other things, in what manner I had made my Fortune in <hi>Germany,</hi> at which ſhe appear'd extreamly well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, and pay'd a Viſit to my Spouſe the next day I took then a reſolution to make the Province of <hi>Languedock</hi> the Seat of my Fortune, after I had taken a turn to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> whither I was oblig'd to go firſt,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65930:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to look after a Debt, due to me from a Perſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I had lent a Summ of Money, whilſt I was in the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Service. I did take my way over <hi>Orleans;</hi> and coming to <hi>Loudun,</hi> the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Ways began to be ſo bad, (the Seaſon being far advanc'd) that I was forc'd to reſolve to tarry there all the Winter.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Loudun</hi> to <hi>Thevars</hi> is no more than five Leagues, whither I went to wait on the Princeſs of <hi>Tarente,</hi> who was retir'd thither after the death of her Spouſe: She did me the Honour to invite me to Dinner, and hearing me ſpeak of ſettling my ſelf in <hi>Languedock,</hi> ſhe did all ſhe could could to engage me to ſtay there abouts. She told me in the moſt obliging manner in the World, that if I would reſolve to buy an Eſtate of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Duke <hi>de Tremoville</hi> her Son, ſhe would take care it ſhould be made ſo eaſie to me, that I ſhould have all the reaſon in the World to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it. There were alſo ſeveral other honeſt Gentlemen of my Acquaintance at <hi>Loudun,</hi> who moſt earneſtly deſir'd me to live among them, and my Wife ſeem'd to be very well pleas'd with this Country, all which together, was a ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to me, to go and take a view of a very fine new Seat, not above two Leagues diſtant from <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> built by Monſieur <hi>de la Grilliere</hi> Counſellor of State, not long before his death. In his Life time there had belong'd a conſiderable Eſtate to it, which being after his death divided betwixt his Heirs, each had diſpos'd of his ſhare to ſeveral Purchaſers; ſo that nothing was left of it entire now, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd of, but that part which fell to his ſhare, who was now owner of the Houſe. I was mightily taken with the Beauty and Uniformity of the Building, which in all its parts was equivalent to a Caſtle, and might well have deſerv'd that Name, if according to the Cuſtom of the Country, this Name could be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any Edifice that has no Towers.</p>
               <p>All that was now left belonging to the Houſe, conſiſted only in two Farms, a Mill, ſome Marſhy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65930:66"/>
Grounds, and two Cloſes of Vineyards, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might yield about Thirty Pipes of Wine <hi>per Annum.</hi> I purchas'd this Eſtate firſt, and afterwards rejoin'd to it ſome other parcels of Land, which had been ſold from it before; as likewiſe ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Fields, which were conveniently ſituated, to make the whole the more entire.</p>

               <head>THE MEMOIRS OF JOHN BAPTIST <hi>De La Fontaine,</hi> Kt. LIB. IV.</head>
               <p>AFter I had ſettl'd my ſelf near <hi>Loudun,</hi> I went to ſee my Father and Siſter, who at that time liv'd at <hi>Falaiſe.</hi> Finding them in a very low condition, ſo as to ſtand in need of my aſſiſtance, I offer'd them my Houſe, which they readily accepted of. My Wife gave them a very kind Entertainment, and my Siſter liv'd with us ſo quietly for the firſt ſix Months, that I begun to conceive great hopes, ſhe had of late chang'd her former ill inclinations. But it ſeems, ſhe was not able to hold out longer, for in a little while after, ſhe began to attempt to act the Miſtriſs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65930:67"/>
of the Houſe, which ſo much diſpleas'd my Spouſe, that ſhe took an opportunity to complain of it to me. I therefore deſir'd my Siſter to alter her Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to conſider, that as I ow'd every thing to my Spouſe, ſo I ought to take care, that ſhe might not be diſpleas'd in her own Houſe. This was a very unpleaſing Leſſon to my Siſter, tho' I ſpoke it with all the fairneſs and moderation imaginable, which made her perſwade my Father, to require a Yearly Penſion from me. The old Gentleman grown frail, by reaſon of his great Age, conſented to her requeſt, and ſign'd a Bill to be preferr'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, in which he demanded a Yearly Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of 500 Crowns.</p>
               <p>Having ſoon got notice of their deſign, I ſpoke to my Father about it, which made him burſt out into Tears like a Child. I could not but be mov'd with Compaſſion, which made me ſay no more of it for that time; but I took the next opportunity to perſwade him, that our beſt way would be to ſend my Siſter into a Nunnery, which he conſented to. She had play'd her part ſo ill, that being aſham'd to ſee the Face of any body thereabouts, ſhe was glad to be gone. But in lieu of going into a Monaſtery, ſhe took her way directly to <hi>Malicorne,</hi> where at that time liv'd Mrs. <hi>Launai,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken before. She did tell her, that knowing how much ſhe always had lov'd me, ſhe was ſure ſhe could not bring her a more welcome News, than that I was not only reviv'd, but was alſo come lately into <hi>France,</hi> with a Wife and five Children. That I had Married a great Fortune in <hi>Germany,</hi> and had now bought my ſelf a very fine Eſtate, in the Province of <hi>Anjou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gentlewoman was ſo Amaz'd at the recital ſhe made her, that for a conſiderable time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd without Senſe or Motion. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that not long before I left <hi>France,</hi> my Father had ſummon'd her into Court, to prove that our Marriage being Illegal ought to be declar'd void: His Proof was founded upon my Minority, and the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65930:67"/>
falſe Certificates I had made uſe of, and knowing that the ſame Plea of my Minority had carried the cauſe againſt my <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spouſe, of which I have given you the Hiſtory before, he did not queſtion but the ſame would alſo ſtand good againſt this. Mrs. <hi>de Launai</hi> put in her Anſwer, in which ſhe ſhew'd that ſhe was a <hi>Minor</hi> as well as my ſelf, when we were Married, and that having been always of an unblemiſh'd Reputation, there was not the leaſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for me to be aſham'd of the Match. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what was offer'd in her behalf, the Judge of the <hi>Memmers,</hi> before whom the Cauſe was pleaded, did by his Decree Annul the ſaid Marriage. Mrs. <hi>Launai,</hi> appeal'd from this Court to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but whilſt ſhe was proceeding with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable vigour againſt me, the news of my ſuppos'd Death, confirm'd by the Certificate forg'd by my Siſter, as I have told you before, prov'd the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that this matter remain'd undecided.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>de Launai</hi> afterwards Married a Lawyer, whoſe Name was <hi>Beſnard,</hi> with whom ſhe liv'd very contentedly at that time, when my Siſter diſturb'd her Repoſe; <hi>Beſnard</hi> having married her for a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, had ſince had two Children by her. He was no ſooner inform'd of the matter, but he reſolv'd to act the part of a good Lawyer, <hi>that is,</hi> he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to get as much Money out of me as he could. I can't be poſitive, whether my Siſter was engag'd in this part of the Cabal, for ſhe has always ſtifly denied it to me.</p>
               <p>But whether ſhe was or not, Mrs. <hi>Launai</hi> took a Journey to <hi>Samur,</hi> from whence ſhe writ me a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which ſhe call'd me her unfaithful Husband, and that I liv'd in Adultery with another Woman. I was extreamly vex'd at this Letter, foreſeeing that this Buſineſs, would prove the occaſion of great diſcontents in my Family, eſpecially to my Spouſe. I judg'd it therefore moſt convenient, to go and ſee Mrs. <hi>Beſnard</hi> at <hi>Samur;</hi> after I had with a great deal of Patience born all her Reproaches, I offer'd her a good Preſent, to prevent any diſturbance,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65930:68"/>
which I fear'd would ariſe from thence in my Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſhe refuſing to hearken to what I propos'd, I return'd to my own home. I had ſcarce been there an hour when ſhe came boldly into the Houſe, with all the aſſurance that could be; and told my Spouſe, that ſhe being my true Wife, it would be beſt for her to pack up her Baggage, and to carry away her Baſtards along with her; that ſhe would make her know who was Miſtriſs of the Houſe, and that ſhe ſhould not lie there as much as one Night longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beſnard,</hi> her Husband, on the other hand, acted his part likewiſe to the life, pretending that he would not receive his Wife into his Houſe. Whilſt I was thus beſet on all ſides, not knowing which way to turn my ſelf firſt, a certain Perſon living at <hi>Loudun,</hi> whom I knew no more than by ſight, came to ſee me. He told me, that being a Relation of Mrs. <hi>Launai,</hi> and my Friend, he would endeavour to bring the matter to an Accommodation betwixt us; That it was a thing granted, that I ought not to have Married, as long as an Appeal was lodg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and that conſequently my laſt Marriage muſt be invalid, till ſuch time I had obtain'd a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree from the Parliament; that every thing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Judgment of Mankind, ought to be look'd upon as uncertain; that perhaps the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might confirm the Decree of the Judge of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> perhaps not; that the ſhorteſt and ſureſt way would be for me, to come to a Compoſition with Mrs. <hi>Beſnard,</hi> by which means I might obtain a Decree ſuitable to my purpoſe. I did at firſt not in the leaſt reliſh this Propoſition, as being of opinion, that my caſe was ſo clear in it ſelf, as not to ſtand in need of Mrs. <hi>Beſnard</hi>'s conſent to carry it againſt her: But my Spouſe would not reſt ſatisfy'd, till I had accepted of his Mediation, ſo that rather than diſoblige her, I conſented to pay Mrs. <hi>Beſnard</hi> 2000 Livers, provided ſhe would procure me a Decree, to declare our former Marriage invalid, which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:65930:68"/>My Siſter was all this while at <hi>Malicorne,</hi> and had got a good Gratuity from Mrs. <hi>Beſnard,</hi> for her good Counſel, which, with what Money I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her when ſhe left my Houſe, ſhe afterwards ſpent at <hi>Alenſon.</hi> Being thus again in diſtreſs, ſhe writ to Madam <hi>de Marle,</hi> who had known her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when her Husband was Intendant of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, offering her Service as a Governeſs to her Daughters. They were very ready to accept of her offer, and deſir'd her to come forthwith to them into <hi>Auvergne,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Marle</hi> being at that time Intendant of that Province.</p>
               <p>Juſt before her arrival, Madam <hi>de Marle</hi> happen'd to die, which made Monſieur <hi>de Marle</hi> to be very glad of her Company, ſuppoſing ſhe might in ſome meaſure, repair to his Daughters the loſs of their Mother: And to ſpeak truth, matters went on pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſmoothly at firſt; but it was not long, before ſhe gave them ſome proofs of her malicious Temper, which was never in its proper Element, unleſs when ſhe could ſet People together by the Ears. This made her ſend word to Madam <hi>de Bragelone,</hi> Siſter to Monſieur <hi>de Marle,</hi> that he was in Love with a Chamber-Maid, and that unleſs he might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon by her perſwaſions, he would certainly Marry her; ſhe deſir'd her above all things not to divulge the Secret, which otherwiſe would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her all the opportunity for the future, of giving her further information of what paſs'd in the Family.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Bragelone</hi> being much ſurpriz'd at ſo odd a piece of News, writ a Letter about it to her Brother, who could not imagine from whence ſhe had it, but had not in the leaſt ſuſpected my Siſter, if by her own imprudence ſhe had not betray'd herſelf, having advis'd his Daughters to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at their Father's Feet, to beg of him to turn the ſaid Chamber-Maid out of Doors. This was enough for Monſieur <hi>de Marle</hi> to gueſs, who 'twas had procur'd his Siſters Letter to him; ſo that, to rid his hands of ſuch a Spie, he ſent his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65930:69"/>
and their Governeſs to a Neighbouring Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery.</p>
               <p>But ſhe purſu'd the ſame trade after ſhe was in the Nunnery, where ſhe conſtantly embroil'd the Nuns among themſelves, and ſometimes the Abbeſs with the Nuns; ſo that being quite tir'd out with her, they deſir'd Monſieur <hi>de Marle</hi> to deliver them from ſo reſtleſs a Spirit, or elſe they muſt beg him to take his Daughters home again. Monſieur <hi>de Marle,</hi> who had pardon'd her firſt Treſpaſs, thought it beſt to lay hold of this opportunity, to rid his Hands of her for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe came once more to <hi>Samur,</hi> from whence ſhe writ a Letter to my Father, giving an account unto what condition ſhe was reduc'd. He ſhew'd me the Letter, and aſſured me in her behalf, that ſhe was heartily ſorry for her former Miſcarriages, and that if I would once more receive her into my Houſe, he would engage his Honour, ſhe ſhould behave herſelf ſo for the future, as that we ſhould not have the leaſt reaſon to repent of it. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I bore to my Father was ſo powerful over me, that I could not refuſe his Requeſt; tho' it was not long, before I had ſufficient occaſion to repent of it.</p>
               <p>I told you before, that my Brother by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſide had conſum'd all his Eſtate; he had a great many Children, and among the reſt a very handſome Daughter, whom I had taken into my Houſe. My unlucky Siſter had been ſo malicious, as to whiſper into my Spouſe's Ears, that I had a more than ordinary kindneſs for this young Woman, which occaſion'd a ſecret grudge betwixt us, before my Wife diſclos'd to me the real cauſe of it; which I ſoon remov'd by putting the young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into a Nunnery.</p>
               <p>About the ſame time there fell a ſlender Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to my Siſter and me, of about 3000 Livers each; and conſidering with my ſelf, that ſhe who had ſpent ſo much Money already, would ſoon diſpatch alſo this ſmall Pittance: I propos'd to my Father a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65930:69"/>
way to prevent it, by attaching it for his uſe; he having ſeveral Bonds and other Deeds in his Hands, by which ſhe acknowledg'd to have receiv'd the greateſt part of the Money, which he ſold his Eſtate for. Theſe Deeds I told him, were a ſufficient proof againſt her, to intitle him to an Attachment of this late Inheritance. My Father agreed with me in opinion, and reſolving to put my advice in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he went to his Trunk to look for theſe Papers, but could not find them. He charg'd his Servant with them, but he deny'd it utterly. At laſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to threaten him ſeverely, telling him, that I would ſend him to the <hi>Lieutenant (or Judge) Criminal,</hi> to extort a Confeſſion from him. This put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a fear, that throwing himſelf at our Feet, he ingenuouſly confeſs'd, how my Siſter had entic'd him to take away a little Trunk of my Father's, in which were all his Writings, and ſecretly to convey it at night into her Chamber, which he had done accordingly, together with the Key, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her directions he had taken out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Pocket; that he had ſeen my Siſter open the Trunk, who took out of it a certain Deed, which, after ſhe had perus'd it well, ſhe threw into the Fire; that <hi>la Roſe</hi> was likewiſe preſent when this was done, who alſo did read the Deed, before it was burnt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>la Roſe</hi> was an old Servant of my Father's, who had liv'd with him above Forty Years; he liv'd now at <hi>Alenſon,</hi> and came frequently to ſee his old Maſter in my Houſe. He had always been a great Favorite of my Siſters, and ſhe had been God-Mother to one of his Children. He happen'd to be juſt then at our Houſe, when my Father's Servant made the before-mention'd Confeſſion; ſo we ſent for him up Stairs, and being confronted with one another, he could not contradict what the other had told; ſo made an ingenuous Confeſſion of the whole matter. Then it was we made our Complaints to the <hi>Judge Criminal,</hi> to take cognizance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who Examin'd both the Servants, and the next day gave Judgment againſt my Siſter, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65930:70"/>
who had carried the Trunk to her Chamber. We went afterwards to a Counſellor, who aſſur'd us that the proofs made before that Judge, were more than ſufficient to intitle my Father to a legal Attachment of all the Goods and Effects, which could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to belong in any wiſe to my Siſter.</p>
               <p>But it was not long, before I had both my Hands full of other matters, which were of much more conſequence to me. My Spouſe's Mother-in-law, who hitherto had been always of opinion, that I would return into <hi>Germany,</hi> having got notice that I had purchas'd an Eſtate, and was ſettl'd in <hi>France,</hi> writ to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, then reſiding at <hi>Paris,</hi> deſiring him to make as narrow enquiry as poſſibly he could, whether I had not ſold ſome of the Jewels and other precious Moveables, which ſhe had formerly laid to my Brother-in-laws Charge; for which purpoſe ſhe had inclos'd a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> deſcribing their Qualities, Weights, and other ſuch like Circumſtances, which ſhe judg'd might be moſt proper for the diſcovery of what ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know. The Ambaſſadour, who was her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſent this <hi>Memorandum</hi> to all the Goldſmiths of <hi>Paris;</hi> but being deceiv'd in his expectation there, he procur'd Letters from the Conſiſtory of <hi>Charen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Loudun,</hi> wherein they promis'd in his Name, the Summ of 10000 Livers, as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſuch Perſon or Perſons, as ſhould be able to make a diſcovery of them. But I had taken ſuch ſure meaſures as to this point, that all the pains they took prov'd labour in vain.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, as this was a buſineſs of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that no body could penetrate into the true meaning of it, without my own Interpretation; this gave occaſion of various Diſcourſes to inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Perſons, who Romanc'd upon it according to their different Opinions and Inclinations. But there was one Story, which paſs'd for the moſt current and trueſt, being founded, as it was reported, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the relation of a certain Merchant, whoſe Name was <hi>Guicherit,</hi> who being a Native of <hi>Loudun,</hi> was ſince ſettl'd at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65930:70"/>He us'd ſometimes to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> to buy ſome <hi>French</hi> Commodities; and was from thence lately come to <hi>Loudun,</hi> to ſee his Brothers and other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who liv'd in that City. After his return into <hi>Holland,</hi> it began to be nois'd about, that his chief Errand at <hi>Loudun,</hi> had been to make an enquiry after me, to take notice of my Perſon, of which he had taken an exact deſcription, according to a Picture he had brought along with him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It was reported, that whilſt I was in <hi>Holland,</hi> deſtitute of Friends and Money, I us'd to exerciſe ſeveral Trades, and eſpecially went for a Peruke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker and a Jeweller; that I us'd to ſtick at nothing to get Money. That whilſt I was at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I had been a kind of a Broker in Jewels, under a <hi>Burgo-Maſter</hi> of <hi>Hoorn,</hi> call'd <hi>John Wyntges,</hi> one of the Directors of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, who had great ſtore of theſe precious Commodities, which made me frequently to travel betwixt <hi>Hoorn</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam.</hi> That I had made Love to one of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks of the ſaid <hi>Burgo-Maſter,</hi> who had neither Wife nor Children; that at laſt I had Married this Woman, who was born at <hi>Alcmar,</hi> and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one <hi>Vinioles</hi> a Waterman; that this was the ſame I had brought along with me into <hi>France,</hi> and who liv'd with me then at <hi>Loudun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That for the reſt, it was not altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that I might have been Married in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> becauſe, beſides ſeveral other Circumſtances, I had been once overheard to ſay, that my elded Son, who dy'd as I told you before, was by a firſt Wife.</p>
               <p>It was alledg'd, that beſides what had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated concerning my Wife's Extraction, it was no difficult matter to find out by her whole Behaviour, that ſhe was no Perſon of any Quality; becauſe ſhe had been ſeen in a Jacket, ſometimes of Pluſh, ſometimes of Stuff, ſuch as the ordinary People wear in <hi>Holland.</hi> That after we had taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Seat near <hi>Loudun,</hi> my Wife finding fault with the Glaſs Windows, which were not very
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65930:71"/>
bright, had mounted upon a Ladder herſelf, and waſh'd them with a Bruſh as they do in <hi>Holland.</hi> That a great many People had ſeen her rub the Window Glaſſes, being mounted on the top of the Ladder. which had at leaſt Thirty Steps, and conſequently might be ſeen at a good diſtance above the Wall belonging to the Houſe. That this had made a great noiſe among the Neighbourhood, who did not know what to make of it, till <hi>Guicherit</hi> had unravel'd the matter, and told them that it was the cuſtom of <hi>Holland.</hi> That no body could take her for a Perſon of Quality, her whole Behaviour hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reſemblance to it, unleſs it were that ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comb'd herſelf, but had always her Hair done up by a Servant. But <hi>Guicherit</hi> had likewiſe unfolded this Riddle, by telling them, that in <hi>Holland</hi> even the meaneſt Servants ſcarce ever dreſs'd their own Hair, but that every where there were certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who made it their livelihood to do it for them.</p>
               <p>It was further added, that her mean deportment, was not only taken notice of by the Citizens Wives of <hi>Loudun,</hi> or the Country Gentlewomen, who liv'd near her, but likewiſe by many Ladies of great Quality; as for Inſtance, by the Ladies of the Houſe of <hi>Chatre,</hi> and many others, who had liv'd for a conſiderable time at Court, and had been very converſant in the Dutcheſs of <hi>Longueville</hi>'s Family; who, as they were unqueſtionable Judges of ſuch a point as this, ſo it was certain, that they were of the ſame opinion with the Neighbouring Gentry, and had declar'd that there were a thouſand Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to be obſerv'd in her Carriage, which had not the leaſt Affinity with thoſe belonging to a Perſon of a noble Birth, whether <hi>German</hi> or <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they would by all means make my Wife a Servant of the <hi>Burgo-Maſter Wyntges.</hi> And to make up the Story, it was related with a great deal of confidence, that after I had Married her, I had the good fortune, by many good Offices, and the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65930:71"/>
I always ſhew'd to the <hi>Burgo-Maſter,</hi> to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him upon all occaſions, to get ſuch an aſcendant over him after ſome Years were paſs'd, that he truſted me with the whole management of his Affairs. That at laſt the <hi>Burgo-Maſter</hi> having undertaken a Journey, and left us abſolute Maſters of his Houſe in his abſence, we had taken that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſeize upon all his Jewels and Gold, and ſo to retire firſt into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and from thence into <hi>France;</hi> it being the eaſieſt thing in the World, to convey any thing ſecretly out of <hi>Holland,</hi> by reaſon of the conveniency of the Carriage, if there is no miſtruſt in the caſe.</p>
               <p>That which confirm'd them in this opinion was, as they ſaid, that a Servant of mine, whom I had brought along with me out of <hi>Holland,</hi> had told to ſome of his Acquaintance at <hi>Loudun,</hi> that in my Journey I was ſorely afraid of being purſu'd, which was the reaſon I never took the great Road, as I was coming into <hi>France;</hi> and that he had obſerv'd even in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that I had caus'd ſome Countrymen to cut down ſeveral Trees, which hindred my paſſage through ſome by Roads.</p>
               <p>It was further reported, that the <hi>Burgo-Maſter Wyntges</hi> did ever ſince make a moſt exact enquiry after me, and was at laſt by chance given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there was a certain Merchant at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Guicherit,</hi> and who could tell him ſome Tydings of me. That my ſudden ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival and Settlement near <hi>Loudun,</hi> together with the repute of my vaſt Riches both in Jewels and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, having made me be look'd upon by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no otherwiſe than if I had been poſſeſs'd of all the Treaſures of <hi>Croeſus;</hi> and that the noiſe of theſe Riches, being at laſt come to the Ears of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Guicherit</hi>'s Family, they had firſt canvaſs'd the matter among themſelves, and at laſt imparted the whole to <hi>Guicherit</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was likewiſe related that the <hi>Burgo-Maſter</hi> having got ſome ſcent of the matter, he found out <hi>Guicherit,</hi> and having enquir'd of him what he wanted to

know concerning my preſent condition, he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with him to undertake this Journey to <hi>Loudun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> after he had firſt engag'd him to write to his Brother, who was then one of the Conſiſtory of <hi>Loudun,</hi> and is now a Refugee in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that were the contrivers of this Story, had likewiſe fram'd ſeveral Circumſtances to make it paſs the more current; and as a Story never loſes by telling, ſo every body did add to it, what he found moſt ſuitable to his own gueſs or opinion. I verily believe, that if it were poſſible for me to know, but half what was laid to my charge, and the various Diſcourſes that were had upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and how I acted my part in <hi>Holland,</hi> I ſay, it would queſtionleſs furniſh me with matter ſufficient, for a good large old faſhion'd Romance.</p>
               <p>But after all theſe malicious Reflections and Threats, the whole matter came to nothing, and my Adverſaries were Eye-witneſs of my living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them undiſturb'd. For <hi>Guicherit,</hi> upon whoſe return they had founded all their Hopes, never came afterwards to <hi>Loudun,</hi> and no body ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make any enquiry after my Affairs, ſince the <hi>Memorandum</hi> ſent by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour. They began then to look at one another, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to make of it; and if they had not been prepoſſeſs'd with a ſtrong prejudice againſt me, it had been eaſie for them to judge, that all theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes were founded upon falſe ſuppoſitions. But as a malicious Tongue is ſo far from retracting, that it rather heaps Calumnies upon Calumnies, ſo they contriv'd a way to unriddle the matter after their own Head. For it was not long before it was ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd about, that ſoon after <hi>Guicherit</hi> was return'd to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the <hi>Burgo-Maſter Wyntges</hi> happen'd to die at <hi>Hoorn;</hi> and that his Eſtate being divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſeveral Heirs, they were ſo well ſatisfi'd with that vaſt Treaſure he had left among them, that they did not think fit to make up a Purſe among them to proſecute me at ſo great a diſtance, and that neither of them had thought it worth
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65930:72"/>
his while to do it upon his own particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Thus I eſcap'd the whole danger, by being made a Country talk for ſome time, which indeed I little valu'd at that time; tho' afterwards, I was at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times made ſenſible of the ill effects of it; Theſe Titles of Vagabond and Sharper, which they had been pleas'd to beſtow upon me, having made very odd Impreſſions upon a great many People, who at leaſt believ'd ſome part of what they heard ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reported.</p>
               <p>It was queſtionleſs this, which encourag'd the Head Keeper of the Duke of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> to write me a <hi>Rhodomontado</hi> Letter, under pretence that I had hunted in his Maſter's Lordſhip. This was true in effect, but it was done with the Duke's conſent, who knew I would not abuſe his Favour, and that a conſiderable time ago, I had belong'd to and been converſant in his Family; which had made him write to me, that I might Hunt in his Juriſdiction, when, where, and as often as I pleas'd. I took particular care not to give him the leaſt reaſon of Complaint; but whether it was, that his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper look'd upon me as an inconſiderable Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, by reaſon of theſe beforemention'd Diſcourſes, or whether he was ſet on by a neighbouring Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman with whom I had a Law Suit, and who was a particular Acquaintance of his; he writ to me in ſuch haughty terms, as if he had been the Duke himſelf, and I one of his under-Keepers. I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that I found he had copied this Letter after one of thoſe his Maſter us'd to write to him, and many other ſmart Reflections: He being a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by Birth, found himſelf ſo much affronted at it, that he made his Complaints to the <hi>Marſhals</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who ſent me a Summons to appear before them at <hi>Paris.</hi> But the thing having reach'd the Duke <hi>de Tremoville</hi>'s Ear, and being unwilling to have him expos'd before the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> he chid him in my preſence, telling him, that he had forc'd this Reply from me by his own Impertinency,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65930:73"/>
and after he had perus'd the Letter he had writ to me, he told him, that he ought not to have writ ſuch a Letter to the worſt Gentleman of the whole Province. So having commanded him to ask my pardon, the matter was compos'd betwixt our ſelves.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I began to grow weary of the Country, which made me undertake a Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I paid a Viſit to Monſieur <hi>Sanguin,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to make uſe of his Intereſt in my behalf, to obtain a Commiſſion in the Army, which had always been my profeſſion. It was at that time ſtrongly diſcourſed at Court, that four new Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were to be eſtabliſh'd, which were to belong to the Ordnance, <hi>to wit,</hi> one of <hi>Germans,</hi> one of <hi>Poles,</hi> one of <hi>Swedes</hi> and one of <hi>Huſſars;</hi> but this Project being laid aſide for that time, my Journey prov'd fruitleſs. Nevertheleſs, we did not live without hopes to ſee the War ſoon re-kindled, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> refus'd to give ſatisfaction to our King, concerning his pretenſions upon <hi>Aloſt.</hi> Several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were held upon this account at <hi>Courtray,</hi> whither both Kings had ſent their Deputies to treat about it, and compoſe the difference in an amicable way. <hi>Lewis the Great,</hi> had alſo propoſed to leave it to the Arbitration of his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not think fit to accept of it. This made the King to order his Troops, to enter in an Hoſtile manner the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very troubleſome to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had his particular deſign, did, by the great Influence he had upon that Court, diſſwade them from giving us due ſatisfaction. Thus it came to an open Rupture by the Seige of <hi>Luxemburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were buſied in making their Lines of Circumvallation, the Prince of <hi>Chirnay,</hi> who was then Governour of the Place, thinking himſelf in a condition to defend the place againſt us; caus'd his Muſick to play upon the Walls for a Bravado, to ſhew how little he valu'd our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65930:73"/>
But it was not long before he found his miſtake, for he was attack'd with ſuch vigour, that he was glad to come to a capitulation. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were earneſtly preſs'd by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to relieve the Place, finding themſelves either not in a condition to undertake it- or being not diſpos'd at that time to follow his advice, remain'd only Spectators of the Conqueſt of this place, without meddling in the leaſt in the matter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not alone extreamly ſenſible of the loſs of this place, but the Emperor bore as great a ſhare in it as any; finding that our King thereby, had conſiderably extended his Conqueſts upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> conſidering eſpecially, that he had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Strasburgh</hi> before, as being a dependance on <hi>Alſace.</hi> But the War, in which the Emperor was at that time engag'd againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> not leaving the leaſt room for the Imperial Court to flatter themſelves, with hopes to act with any ſucceſs, at the ſame time upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi> it was reſolv'd at the Dyet of the Empire, to accept of the Twenty Years Truce, offer'd by his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Not long after my return home from <hi>Paris,</hi> my Father dy'd, in the 89th Year of his Age. Juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, he recommended my Siſter to my Care, and deſir'd me to pardon all what was paſs'd, and to take the ſame care of her, as if ſhe never had committed any thing againſt me. I promis'd him to do what he deſir'd, and it has not been my fault, that ſhe has not reap'd the Fruits of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſince. Whilſt he lay ſick, I ſent for a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an living at <hi>Montreville,</hi> who refus'd to come, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Servant, What I meant by ſending to him? whether I intended to play the Fool with him? it being well known, that I underſtood more in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, than all the Country Doctors thereabouts; and upon this occaſion, I cannot forbear to tell you how it came to paſs, that I acquir'd the Reputation of a famous Phyſician.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65930:74"/>One time being at <hi>Tours,</hi> to look after a Law Suit I was engag'd in at that time againſt my Siſter, a certain young Woman, one of the moſt confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the whole City, being Siſter to the Chanter (or chief manager of the Muſick) in the Cathedral there, had a Swelling, which all the Phyſicians there did not know what to make of. Some were of opinion it was a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the King's-Evil, and that it muſt be laid open. Her Parents were very unwilling to cónſent to the opening of it, becauſe it was juſt upon the Knee, and conſequently might prove of dangerous conſequence, by reaſon of the conjunction of many Nerves near that place. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by chance ſomebody talk of it one day, I had the curioſity to go and ſee her, becauſe I had made my obſervations in <hi>Germany,</hi> that they us'd frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cure ſwellings upon the Knee by ſimple Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations. I no ſooner caſt my Eyes upon the Swelling, but I found that it was one of the ſame kind, which made me tell them, that if they would truſt to my skill, I did not queſtion but to cure her. Her Parents having given their conſent, I got my Remedy prepar'd, and apply'd it to the Tumour. She found ſome relief the ſame day, after the firſt application; and to be ſhort, the Remedy ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo well, and its effect was ſo quick and ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that it was not long before ſhe could walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad again.</p>
               <p>This Cure being perform'd upon a Perſon of note at <hi>Tours,</hi> I got ſuch a Reputation by it, that I was look'd upon there, as one of the moſt skilful Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the Country. The beſt of all was, that one of the Phyſicians of the City happen'd to be ſeiz'd with a violent Cholick, proceeding from the Gravel in the Kidnies, and after he had try'd all his own Remedies, ſent one of his Acquaintance to me, to deſire my Advice. I went to ſee him, and finding what was the true cauſe of his Diſtemper, I gave him a certain Remedy, which I had formerly ſeen prepar'd at <hi>Berlin,</hi> which I order'd him to take, as they commonly do in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Compoſition
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65930:74"/>
was made of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> about half the bigneſs of a large Pea, of a certain doſe of <hi>Chryſtal mineral,</hi> and half an ounce of <hi>Black Radiſh Seeds,</hi> the outward Rind of which is black, but the inſide as white as a Turnip. This I infus'd in White-wine, and ſo gave it to the Patient. This was the whole foundation of my Doctorſhip. But this Remedy, as ſimple as it appears, ſucceeded as well as the former, which made me to be cry'd up all over the City of <hi>Tours,</hi> for one of the moſt able Phyſicians they had ſeen a great while; ſo that I verily believe, if I had been put to it, I might have got a very good livelihood by the practice of Phyſick there: So true it is, that outward appearances are very deceitful, and that a ſlender accident ſometimes proves of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For the Nuns of <hi>Beaumont</hi> ſent one to Compliment me immediately after, who told me, that being fully perſwaded of my extraordinary abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Phyſick, they hop'd I would come and pay them a Viſit, but I civilly excus'd it.</p>
               <p>It was much about this time, that the deſtruction of the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>France,</hi> was warmly debated at Court: The King, who at preſent ſaw all his Dominions enjoy the fruits of Peace and Tranquility, without the leaſt fear of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd in it for the future, being reſolv'd to lay hold of this juncture, to give the finiſhing ſtroak to the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party. The King had for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time before, given them ſuch evident marks of his Diſpleaſure and averſion to them, that there were very few in <hi>France,</hi> who did not foreſee their Ruin, except themſelves. The King's averſion to them, was ſo generally known and taken notice of all over the Kingdom, that many of the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> made it their buſineſs to affront the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants upon the leaſt occaſion, either out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Zeal, or to curry favour with the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the Provinces, who encourag'd them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, purſuant to the Orders they had receiv'd from Court, to favour as much as poſſibly could be done, thoſe who ſhould ſhew themſelves Zealots,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65930:75"/>
and Inſtrumental in the deſtruction of a Religion, which was look'd upon as directly oppoſite to the Intereſt of the State.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion, I cannot but relate what was done on this account, by a certain Prieſt in our Neighbourhood, who profeſs'd himſelf always a great Zealot againſt the Proteſtants, and by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices was likely to have prov'd the ruine of a great many People. I had about that time a Servant, a very ſimple and fooliſh Fellow, who after he went from me, liv'd in the ſame Quality with one of the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs of the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> of <hi>Loudun,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Ceſvet Beſnard.</hi> This Fellow happen'd to have an amorous Intrigue with his Maſter's Daughter; (which I think I may ſay without injuſtice to truth) One day as he went to Confeſſion to the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryars, whoſe Monaſtery was not far from the Bailiffs Houſe, he happen'd to pitch upon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, who being an acquaintance of his Maſters, did exaggerate his Crime to the higheſt degree; and among other things told him, that beſides God's Vengeance which he had drawn upon him, it was no leſs than Death by the Law, for a Servant to kiſs his Maſter's Daughter. Theſe words made ſo ſtrong an Impreſſion upon this ſimple Fellow, that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himſelf every moment in danger of being hang'd, he told to another Servant of mine, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to his Father, that it was high time for him to go away at ſuch a diſtance, as that no body might hear any further tydings of him, being ſenſible that he had deſerv'd Death, and living in continual fear leſt God ſhould deſervedly puniſh him for his Crime.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryar his Confeſſor, having got notice in what manner his words had wrought upon the ſimplicity of this poor Wretch, and willing to oblige his Neighbour <hi>Ceſvet,</hi> by removing from his Daughter an Object, which in all likelihood would bring her in time to ſhame and confuſion, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Fellow to go to <hi>Gardelupe,</hi> in quality of a Servant to the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Fryars there. This poor
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65930:75"/>
Wretch, who had nothing to truſt to, and being a Peaſants Son, and accuſtom'd to all manner of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſoon accepted his offer; and being by the <hi>Carmelite</hi> furniſh'd with all things neceſſary for his Voyage, and embark'd in a good Bottom, went to <hi>Gardelupe,</hi> without giving notice to any body whither he was to go.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the words he had ſpoke to my Servant and his Father, were canvaſs'd about, and going from one to another, at laſt came to the knowledge of this my neighbouring Prieſt, of whom I ſpoke juſt now. His Name was <hi>d'Arſac</hi> Prior of <hi>Ternai,</hi> he had a Nephew a Gentleman of that Country, of whom I ſhall have occaſion to ſay ſomething anon. This Prieſt conſidering with himſelf, what Crime it could be that had made the Fellow utter theſe words, concluded at laſt, that it could be no leſs than a Sacrilege, to expiate which he had been ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive his abſolution there; what confirm'd him in this conjecture was, that he had underſtood, this Fellow had been a Servant to a certain <hi>Hugonot,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigneraie.</hi> Being ſtrongly poſſeſs'd with this Fancy, he concluded further, that this ſimple Wretch had taken out of his Mouth the Conſecrated Hoſt, he had receiv'd at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Eve, which he had carried to his Maſter, who with ſome other <hi>Hugonots,</hi> had (as he imagin'd) made ſome ſtrange uſe of it. The worſt of all was, that this Prieſt did not relate this, as being the Product of his own Brains, but as if it had been told him thus by others. He at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted about the matter with the Father <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Loudun,</hi> who having related the matter to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the Pariſh, a turbulent Spirit, and a declar'd Enemy of the Proteſtants, he gave information of it before a Judge.</p>
               <p>The Servant having receiv'd Intelligence (queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs by the means of the <hi>Carmelites</hi>) how his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>la Chateigneraie</hi> was accus'd of a Crime, of which he was altogether innocent, and that he was in danger of his Life, writ two Letters from <hi>Garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupe,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65930:76"/>
one to his Father, the other to the Curate of the Pariſh of <hi>Arſai,</hi> who was his God-Father, in which he declar'd that his Maſter <hi>la Chateigneraie</hi> was abſolutely innocent, and what Crime had been committed, was betwixt him and the Bailiffs Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His Father ſent the Letter to the owner of the Farm, in which he liv'd, in the Town of <hi>Renton,</hi> who being a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> carried it to Madam <hi>Bourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> who was a <hi>Catholick</hi> and Lady of the Mannour there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceſvet</hi> and his Kindred having underſtood out of this Letter, that this poor Fellow was at <hi>Gardelupe,</hi> join'd their Intereſt with all the Zealous <hi>Catholicks</hi> of that City, to obtain an Order for the bringing over of him from that Iſland, in hopes to improve his ſimplicity to their advantage, and either by Threats or Perſwaſions to make him change his tune, when they had him in Priſon.</p>
               <p>Thus was this unfortunate Wretch re-conducted into <hi>France,</hi> with the firſt Veſſel that came from thence, his Arms and Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Fetter'd, and had a Dungeon an gn'd him for his Lodgings. The Judges of <hi>Loudun,</hi> upon the bare depoſition of the Prior, examin'd him concerning what was laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>Being confronted with the Prieſt, he confeſs'd that before his departure he had ſpoke theſe Words, I have related before, but deny'd poſitively, that it had been upon that account, as it was interpreted by the Prior, and upon whoſe Evidence he ſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd. The Judges urg'd him to declare without equivocation, what it was that had induc'd him to expreſs himſelf in theſe Terms; to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that the ſame hdd been occaſion'd by ſome Expreſſions, which his Father Confeſſor had us'd to him upon another Subject, which had terrify'd him to that degree, as to have ſpoken the ſaid Words. The Judges then ſent for the Father Confeſſor, to know whether he had confeſs'd the truth, as to that point, but he excus'd himſelf, and would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what had been confeſs'd to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65930:76"/>But Mrs. <hi>Ceſvet</hi> the Bailiff's Wife, began to be very uneaſie about her Daughter, for fear of a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of the matter, which made her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with one Mrs. <hi>Chapelet</hi> her Siſter-in-law, what was, beſt to be done in this exigency, to ſave her Daughter's Reputation. The reſult of the matter was, that they ſhould endeavour to ſuborn falſe Witneſſes, to ſwear Sacrilege againſt the poor Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which they did accordingly, having procur'd three Women, who for twelve Buſhels of Wheat (to be given to each as a Reward) undertook to charge him with the Sacrilege. Their Evidence, together with the Circumſtances and Words, made uſe of by this unfortunate Fellow, at parting with my Servant, were more than ſufficient to do his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; for which reaſon alſo, his old Maſter <hi>la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigneraie</hi> was ſummon'd to appear, which he did accordingly, and declar'd that their Accuſations were utterly falſe, as indeed they were.</p>
               <p>But this would have avail'd him but little, it being certain that this poor Wretch muſt have ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably been loſt, and many more Proteſtants, but eſpecially <hi>la Chateigneraie</hi> would have been involv'd in great troubles, if among theſe three Women, that had been ſuborn'd to depoſe againſt the poor Fellow, one being touch'd with remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and deteſting ſo foul a Fact, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted her promiſe, and refus'd to join with the others. But tho' the other two perſiſted ſteadfaſtly in their deviliſh Reſolution, yet it pleas'd God to bring to light their black deſigns; they diſagreeing, nay contradicting one another in their Depoſitions, upon a ſtrict Examination made by the Judges. For, being examin'd ſeparately, the Judges, among other Queſtions ask'd the firſt, in what place ſhe had heard the Priſoner give them an account of having committed this Sacrilege; ſhe anſwer'd, that it was in one Mr. <hi>Beſnard</hi>'s (who was Unkle to the Bailiff) War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, which according to the Dialect of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, implies as much, as a Cloſe enclos'd with a Wall, as he was weeding of Wheat: But the other,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65930:77"/>
upon Examination declar'd, that he told it them in the open Field, which fronts the Gates of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Judge Criminal and the King's Sollicitor, who were both Perſons of Integrity, and of a far different ſtamp from moſt of the other Officers of Juſtice, belonging to <hi>Loudun;</hi> but eſpecially the King's Sollicitor, being convinc'd of the foulneſs of the thing, were reſolv'd to try all means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth, tho' with the hazard of incurring the diſpleaſure of the Court, in not obeying their Orders without exception.</p>
               <p>They manag'd the matter with ſo much prudence and dexterity, that at laſt they brought both theſe perfidious Women to a ſincere Confeſſion, how matters had been tranſacted betwixt them. But the Bailiff and his Kindred, together with many of the Zealots of the City, did not only grumble heavily againſt this proceeding of the Judges, but being ſenſible that it was at this juncture look'd upon at Court as an unpardonable Crime, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travene the late Ordinances, under what pretence ſoever, they made heavy Complaints againſt them at Court.</p>
               <p>An Order was thereupon ſent to Monſieur <hi>de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> Intendant of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to Summon the Judges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and to give an account of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.

and accordingly was carried to <hi>Paris.</hi> I had been ſeveral times to ſee this unfortunate Creature in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all his Words and whole Behaviour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me, ſo full of natural ſimplicity, that if I had had no other reaſon to acquit him in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, this alone, would have been a ſtrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to me of his Innocence. It was upon this ſcore, I writ to Monſieur <hi>Berault,</hi> a famous Counſellor at <hi>Paris,</hi> to deſire him to inform the Judges punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in what manner his Trial had been carried on at <hi>Loudun.</hi>

                  </gap>t that very juncture, give us a moſt ſignal Inſtance of his Juſtice, in puniſhing my Servant for the Crime he had committed, in accuſing this poor Fellow, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he had ſpoke to him, they having not the leaſt relation to what he was charg'd withal by his Adverſaries. For, before this miſerable Wretch was condemn'd to Death, my Servant grew furiouſly mad, to that degree, that no body durſt come near him. In his lucid Intervals he would frequently declare, that God had dealt juſtly with him, becauſe he had faſly accus'd an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But, as theſe Intervals were in a manner but momentaneous, and that on the other hand, his mad Fits return'd without any remarkable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, no real account could be made of what be ſaid.</p>
               <p>One day he got, unperceiv'd by any body, out of his Lodging Room, where I kept him out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in hopes he might recover his Senſes, and ſtript himſelf quite naked in the open Field.</p>
               <p>A Lad of about eighteen Years of Age, who happen'd to ſee him, did run immediately after him, which the Madman perceiving, he hid himſelf behind a Tree; but the Lad coming up pretty near to him, firſt play'd the fool with him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pelted him with Stones: This put the Mad-Fellow into ſuch a fury, that he came out from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Tree, where he had hid himſelf, laid hold of the young Lad, and after he had thrown him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65930:78"/>
down upon the ground, knock'd his Brains out with a Flint-ſtone, which he had found accidentally; after he had kill'd him, he gnaw'd his Face, juſt as if it had been done by ſome voracious Creature.</p>
               <p>Some Peaſants happening to paſs by that way ſeiz'd him, and carry'd him Priſoner to <hi>Berry,</hi> a place under the Juriſdiction of the Duke <hi>de Tremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> But it being known that he was a Madman, he was not try'd for his Life, but the Judges diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him after a Months Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>After his diſcharge he came again to my Houſe, where I took care to have him cloſely guarded, for fear of ſuch another misfortune, till I could ſend to his Parents to take him home. The place where he was kept was Barricado'd with Iron Bars, but he found means to break through them; and as he was juſt getting out, a Countryman, who liv'd in one of my Farms ſaw him; but being afraid to be ſerv'd as the Lad was before, he call'd my Warren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to his aſſiſtance. The Madman made up to them both, which the Warrener being aware of, he wounded him with his <hi>Fuzee</hi> of which he died ſix days after. The loſs of Blood occaſion'd by his Wound, having reſtor'd him to his right Senſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, he receiv'd the Holy Sacrament, and at the ſame time declar'd, that he had falſly accus'd that unfortunate Fellow, who was then in Priſon; and theſe his laſt dying Words were put in writing, and ſent to <hi>Paris</hi> for his Juſtification.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Parliament being fully convinced of the Innocence of this poor Wretch, not ſo much by the Confeſſion of this Mad Fellow, as by ſeveral other undeniable proofs, he was acquitted, and the two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Women Sentenc'd to be Whip'd, and branded with the <hi>Flower-de-luce;</hi> a ſlight Puniſhment, bearing but a ſlender proportion to the hainouſneſs of their Crime, according to the <hi>Lex Talionis.</hi> Nevertheleſs they thought themſelves very hardly dealt withal, conſidering they had ſtood it out to the laſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being inveigled by the fair Promiſes made them by the Zealous Party. Thus they had flatter'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65930:78"/>
themſelves with hopes to eſcape Puniſhment, by their powerful Interceſſion; but when they found themſelves deceived in their vain hopes, and that they were carried to the place where they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Whip'd, and forced beſides this to do publick Penance in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, they began to lament their Condition, and to make moſt bitter Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt thoſe who had hired them to commit ſuch a Villainy; they made, I ſay, bitter Invectives againſt Mrs. <hi>Ceſvet</hi> the Bayliffs Wife, and her Siſter-in-Law Mrs. <hi>Chapelet,</hi> who with ſeveral others had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in bringing them to Shame and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by their falſe Promiſes. As for Mrs. <hi>Ceſvet,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Chapelet,</hi> they retired into a Monaſtery, where they continued for ſome Years after, till at laſt they began by degrees to appear abroad again.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this, the Prior of <hi>Ternai</hi> could not reſt ſatisfied, but would needs write a Letter directed to the King himſelf, in which he pretended to ſhew, that Juſtice had not been impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially adminiſtred in a Caſe, which in a moſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, concerned no leſs than the Glory of God: He remonſtrates to the King, That the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks being encouraged by this Impunity, would for the future, not ſtick at any thing, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch like Inſinuations. The King thereupon diſpatched his Orders a ſecond time to Monſieur <hi>de Baville;</hi> who, as I told you before, was Intendant of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to conſult with the Chief Juſtice of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and to examine the whole Matter in all its Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But Monſieur <hi>de Baville,</hi> with all the pains he took, was not able to find out any thing more than what had been done before, unleſs it were to diſcover the extravagant Zeal and Malice of the Prior of <hi>Ternai.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Account I was willing to give you of the prepoſterous Zeal of this Prieſt having interrupted in ſome meaſure, my Relation of the King's Deſign againſt the Hugonots, it will now be time to reaſſume the ſaid Theme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:65930:79"/>It is therefore to be obſerved, That ſome of the moſt quick-ſighted among the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the Thunder-clap was likely to ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, did propoſe ſeveral Aſſemblies to be held, to conſult of Ways and Means to prevent the Storms which they believed would prove fatal to them: For which purpoſe they call'd together their Synods at <hi>Thouars</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and at <hi>Sorges</hi> in <hi>Anjou.</hi> In the Synod of <hi>Sorges,</hi> there were two <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters, one of <hi>Bauge,</hi> the other of <hi>Painperdu,</hi> who having either a further inſight into their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition than the reſt, or being leſs prepoſſeſt with vain Opinions than ſome of their Brethren, did propoſe to conſult about ſome means, how to unite themſelves with the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſeeing they could not find any ſufficient reaſon, why the ſame might not be effected at this time, and why the ſame ſhould be oppoſed by ſome of their Brethren.</p>
               <p>They alledged, for the confirmation of this their Opinion, That indeed in former Times, the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> had been repreſented to the World as Idolaters, becauſe the true Tenets of their Religion were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not rightly underſtood by ſome, or diſguiſed by others: But that the Caſe was quite alter'd now, ſince the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> had obliged the Chriſtian World with the true Pourtraiture of the Catholick Religion; That indeed it was objected by ſome, that he had been very careful in diſguiſing the real Sentiments of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction favoured more of Obſtinacy and Prejudice, than real Truth; and would meet ſcarce with any Encouragement among People of Senſe, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if the Thing were as they pretended, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would be the firſt that would contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his Opinion, whereas the Approbation this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe had met with from the Conclave, and the whole College of Cardinals, was a convincing Proof, that the Biſhop had aſſerted nothing but what is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conformable to the Doctrine received in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church. That thoſe, who after ſuch authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Proofs would pretend to contradict it, did do
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65930:79"/>
nothing but to ſhew not only their Obſtinacy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an unaccountable Averſion towards an Union among them. That they conjured their Brethren to weigh duly and maturely all and every Circumſtance of the matter which might lead them into the Path to procure Peace and Tranquility to their Churches, which could not be obtained, unleſs they would at this juncture be pleaſed to take a Reſolution ſuitable to their Prudence and Charitable Inclinations.</p>
               <p>But all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters aſſembled in this Synod, were ſo far from giving a favourable Ear to their Reaſons and Exhortations, that they exclaim'd againſt their Counſel, as proceeding from a depraved Mind, and from the conſideration of their temporal Intereſt, either to preſerve themſelves, or perhaps to encreaſe their Revenues.</p>
               <p>But theſe two Miniſters finding them abſolutely bent to their own Deſtruction, did, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to theſe Calumnies, make Abjuration of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, at the concluſion of the Synod, and were joyfully received into the Boſom of the Church, having by their Moderation, and Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Advice, deſervedly acquired the Eſteem and good Will both of the Court and Clergy. But the worſt was, that there were but few among the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there, who would follow their Footſteps.</p>
               <p>The King provok'd to the higheſt degree by their Obſtinacy, did publickly revoke the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and Quarter'd his Dragoons upon all ſuch as refuſed to obey his Commands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at <hi>Loudun</hi> uſed frequently to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in private, to encourage one another rather to ſuffer any thing than to renounce their Religion. There were two noted Counſellors among them, whoſe Names were <hi>Feſtes</hi> and <hi>Montaut,</hi> they being two Elders of this Congregation, and conſidered as Leading Men by reaſon of their great Learning and Riches; theſe began one Day to ſpeak in very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous Terms to the Aſſembly, and to inſinuate ſuch things, that the reſt, who for the moſt part, were influenced by their Counſel, did not know what to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65930:80"/>
make of it. But thoſe, who had reſolved to ſtand immoveable in their firſt Principles, were not ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that they ſoon gueſs'd at their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>They did not now in the leaſt queſtion, but that in the laſt Viſits theſe two Counſellors had made to Monſieur <hi>de Nointel</hi> Intendant of <hi>Touraine,</hi> who had ſent for them, it had been agreed betwixt them which ſide they were to take. And they were not miſtaken in their gueſs; for no ſooner did the King's Dragoons appear at <hi>Loudun,</hi> but <hi>Feſter</hi> ſent for the Prieſts who were appointed to receive the Abjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to his Houſe, where all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Families of any Note were aſſembled, all which were at once reconciled to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, except three Families, who were forced not long after to take up their Lodgings in the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital; for the Dragoons were Quartered upon them to conſume all their Subſtance, and did not leave their Houſes, as long as they had a Morſel left for their Suſtenance.</p>
               <p>The Happineſs of a moſt profound Peace which the Kingdom enjoyed at that time under the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the moſt Glorious Prince of the Univerſe, who had carried the Terrour of his Arms all over <hi>Europe,</hi> was a ſufficient inducement to the King to promiſe himſelf (as I told you before) Succeſs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing he ſhou'd undertake for the future; and it muſt be confeſs'd, that the happy Progreſs he made, did juſtifie the Goodneſs of his Intentions, God was pleaſed to bleſs his Deſigns with ſucceſs, as tending to the increaſe of his Glory, and this ſo powerful Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which under his Majeſty's Predeceſſors Reigns had almoſt brought this great Monarchy to the very brink of Deſtruction, was forced tamely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Commands, without the leaſt Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs this was not the only thing which took up the King's care at that time, he was too wiſe to let ſlip the leaſt Opportunity which ſeem'd to have any relation to the Intereſt of his Crown, as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65930:80"/>
well in reſpect of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> as the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and it was upon this Score, That he made uſe of his Authority and Intereſt, to have ſuch a Coadjutor choſen to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi> as, he knew, to be addicted to his Intereſt. The Situation of this Electorate, did in ſome meaſure oblige the King to take this ſeaſonable Precaution, becauſe it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Territories, who were very jealous of the King's preſent Proſperity. The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conqueſts of his Majeſty were alſo an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Emperour, who a few Years before, had been put to the utmoſt hazard of loſing his Crown, if Fortune had not declared at the very critical jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtupendious Succeſs with which his Arms had been Crown'd ſince on that ſide, gave him no ſmall hopes, that after the Conqueſt of <hi>Hungary,</hi> he might promiſe himſelf the ſame ſucceſs on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> if he could by ſome means or other break the Truce concluded with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. Our King, who was reſolved not to let ſlip this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to thwart the Deſigns both of the Emperour and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and to ſecure to himſelf the <hi>Lower Rhine,</hi> in caſe of a rupture with them, left Inſtructions to bring this Matter to a good Iſſue.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Furſtembergh,</hi> chief Miniſter of the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and Canon of the Cathedral of that Name, who ow'd every thing to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, was pitch'd upon by the King as a fit Subject to fill up this Archiepiſcopal Chair, whenever it ſhould become vacant. The Elector himſelf had made a <hi>Poſtulation</hi> of a <hi>Coadjutor,</hi> to the Chapter of <hi>Cologne,</hi> and moſt of its Members were either in the King's or Cardinal's Intereſt. The Chapter was aſſembled, before the Imperial Party could make their Cabals to diſappoint our Deſign, ſo that of five and twenty Canons, of which this Chapter is compos'd, there were no more than five, who did not give their Voice for the Cardinal. This was no ſmall Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both to the Emperour and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were moſt nearly concerned in it; but there being no other way
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65930:81"/>
left for them to redreſs themſelves, the Emperour made his Applications to the then Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. whom he earneſtly intreated not to approve of the ſaid Election, for fear, as it was inſinuated by his Agents, all <hi>Europe</hi> might thereby be involved in great Troubles.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. was a very Pious Perſon, but he was alſo a Man, and conſequently ſubject to ſome Frailties; and he did not ſtick at this time to make uſe of this juncture, to mortifie his Majeſty, with whom he had had ſome difference of late. The Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Franchiſes of the Quarters of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, ſtuck among the reſt, ſo cloſe in his Stomach, that he would not grant his Bull to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> happen'd to Die not long after, and our King, who had certain Intelligence that the Emperor and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by the help of their Money, had made a ſtrong Party in that Chapter, adviſed the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtemburgh</hi> to ſtand by his firſt Election as <hi>Coadjutor</hi> of the late Archbiſhop and that whatever he did, he ſhould, if poſſibly he could not let it come to a New Election. The Cardinal ſent this Anſwer to the King, That he had not the leaſt reaſon to fear a New Election, being ſure, that he ſhould at leaſt have as many Voices as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and perhaps more, whereas, if he ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this new Election, and enter his Proteſt againſt the meeting of the Chapter, this might perhaps prove a means to abalienate the Minds of many of the Capitulars from his Intereſt, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it muſt be feared, they might make uſe of the ſame pretext, as the Emperor and his Faction had already done; <hi>to wit,</hi> that his former Election to the <hi>Coadjutorſhip</hi> was void, becauſe the ſame had not been confirm'd in the Arch-Biſhop's life time.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons were at laſt approved of by the King, who ſuppoſing, that he who was upon the ſpot, could give a better and nearer gueſs at the matter, than thoſe who were at a diſtance, yielded to his perſwaſions. Thus the Chapter of <hi>Cologne</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:65930:81"/>
aſſembled, in order to proceed to the Election of a new Arch-Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Some of the Canons, who under hand had diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their Voices to the Emperor and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> broke their word with the Cardinal, and gave their Suffrages to Prince <hi>Joſeph Clement,</hi> Brother to the preſent Elector of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> ſo that the Cardinal, in lieu of Seventeen Voices, which he had at his firſt Election, had now no more than. Fourteen, Prince <hi>Joſeph</hi> had Nine, and the Count <hi>de Requ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>en</hi> One.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that to put any Election of this nature beyond all conteſt, it is requiſite to have two thirds of the Voices of the whole Chapter; ſo that the Cardinal in this laſt Election, fell ſhort by two: Thus the Cardinal ſaw himſelf in a much worſe condition than he would have been, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our King's advice, he had adhered to his firſt Election.</p>
               <p>The Pope, who had already in the former Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made uſe of his Authority in oppoſition to the Cardinal, did in this laſt, not in the leaſt alter his opinion; and confirm'd the Election of Prince <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Clement</hi> of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> But, notwithſtanding this Confirmation, the buſineſs now in queſtion was, how he ſhould put himſelf in poſſeſſion of the ſaid Electorate, almoſt all the places of ſtrength being in the hands of the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be legally choſen Arch-Biſhop and Elector of <hi>Cologne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the late Elector was, beſides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>e Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Cologne,</hi> alſo Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Leige</hi> The Cardinal had for a conſiderable time before, made his Court to that Chapter, he being a Canon, as well of the Cathedral of <hi>Leige,</hi> as of that of <hi>Cologne;</hi> but he had many and great Enemies among them; not that he had contributed any thing to it in his own Perſon, but this averſion was founded upon ſome reaſons of State.</p>
               <p>The ill ſucceſs the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtenburgh</hi> had met with, in the laſt Election at <hi>Cologne,</hi> ſeem'd to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65930:82"/>
be but an ill <hi>Omen</hi> of what was to happen in this; but the King, to further as much as poſſible could be, his Intereſt by his Authority, ſent Monſieur <hi>Asfelt</hi> to <hi>Liege</hi> as his Envoy.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Asfelt</hi> was a Perſon of a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wit, and of ſo pleaſing a Converſation, that he was look'd upon as the fitteſt Man to influence the Capitulars of <hi>Leige,</hi> who lov'd extreamly to be flatter'd. But there were ſuch weighty Reaſons (as they believ'd) againſt the Election of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the contrary Party had known how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them ſo well to his diſadvantage, that they could in no wiſe be prevail'd upon, to comply with our King's deſires, tho' there were many of the Canons at the ſame time, who, very unwilling to diſoblige the King in any thing, offer'd to give their Voices to the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>d'Asfelt,</hi> according to his Orders receiv'd from Court, anſwer'd them, that the King had pitch'd upon the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> as the only fit Subject to be recommended by him to the Chapter of <hi>Liege,</hi> and that therefore, whomſoever they ſhould chuſe elſe, could not be acceptable to his Majeſty at this time; and that therefore, if they would preſerve the honour of his Favour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ought to be very cautious, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to take in this Conjuncture.</p>
               <p>The Emperor on the other hand ſent to <hi>Liege</hi> the Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> Grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Son of the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and Brother to the preſent Empreſs, He was likewiſe a Canon of the Cathedral of <hi>Liege,</hi> and brought along with him Letters of Recommendation from his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to the Chapter.</p>
               <p>It is to be known that the Chapter of <hi>Liege,</hi> is compos'd of more than three times the number of Capitulars, than that of <hi>Cologne,</hi> Perſons of divers Nations and Degrees being admitted into it; ſo that one of the meaneſt rank has as good a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be a Capitular of <hi>Liege,</hi> as any of the firſt Quality. They were at that time divided into
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65930:82"/>
three ſeveral Factions. One was for the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> another for Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Niewburgh,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order; the third Faction, which was the ſtrongeſt of all, declar'd againſt both, but more eſpecially againſt the Election of the Cardinal of <hi>Furſtenburgh,</hi> becauſe, as it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, he had about his Perſon, ſuch as would diſpoſe of every thing for Money. The main ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception they made againſt the Maſter of the <hi>Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Order was, that he being a Prince, who had but a ſlender Eſtate of his own, would conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſupport his Grandeur, be forc'd to load the People with heavy Taxes. There were alſo not a few among the Canons, who pretending to have a more than ordinary inſight into the future State of Affairs, and conſidering how narrowly the Intereſt of this Prince was link'd to that of the Emperor's, by reaſon of their near Affinity, did not without reaſon fear, that he might entangle their State in continual Broils and Troubles with <hi>France,</hi> which was not only their Neighbour, but even in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of two Cities belonging to the ſaid Biſhoprick, to wit, <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Dinant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons, with ſome other weighty Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which had made very deep Impreſſions upon the Minds of moſt of the Capitulars, made them by degrees turn their Eyes upon the great <hi>Dean</hi> of the Chapter, a perſon very far advanc'd in Years, without the leaſt Ambition, and for the reſt, one, who had ſcarce any neceſſary qualifications, for the Governing of a State. Neither did he in the leaſt dream of any ſuch thing, the whole Buſineſs of his Life, for theſe ſeveral Years laſt paſt, having been to ſpend his time in Pious Exerciſes; and he was ſo far from aſpiring to the Princely Dignity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of his Days, that he did all what in him lay, to diſſwade his Brethren from it. But the Sub-Dean of the Chapter, whoſe Name was <hi>de Mean,</hi> a Man who had an equal ſhare of Piety and Wit, and who was the Head of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gave them ſuch convincing Reaſons to perſiſt in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65930:83"/>
their Reſolution, that whatever Monſieur <hi>Asfelt</hi> could do they ſtood immoveable.</p>
               <p>The King had no ſooner been advertis'd of it, but it was agreed to conſent to the Cardinal of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi>'s being Elected to that Biſhoprick; but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd ſo unfortunately, that the Meſſenger who carried the Diſpatches and a Letter to the Chapter, did not arrive at <hi>Liege</hi> till the Day of the Election, and what was worſe than all the reſt, not till after the Chapter was Aſſembled. The Meſſenger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being come to the Gate where the Aſſembly was held, and ſending up word that he had a Letter to deliver to the Chapter from our King, it was taken into conſideration what was beſt to be done in this caſe.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that whilſt each Faction were ſtrengthning their Party at <hi>Liege,</hi> ſome out of an indiſcreet Zeal for the Cardinal had threatened, that our King would carry Fire and Sword into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Liege,</hi> if they did not elect Cardinal <hi>Furſtenburgh</hi> for their Biſhop. Their Threats had appear'd to ſome of the Capitulars like ſure preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of what they fear'd might happen hereafter; when they underſtood that a conſiderable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>French</hi> Troops was advancing towards the City.</p>
               <p>The Chapter imagining that this Letter was ſent by the King to give them notice, and to forewarn them of his Intentions, judg'd it moſt convenient, either not to receive the Letter at all, or at leaſt not to open it till after the Election was over. This being done accordingly, there were many of the Canons, who heartily repented of their Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, when they ſaw that they might have had for their Prince and Biſhop, the Cardinal <hi>de Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon,</hi> who was extreamly belov'd at <hi>Liege,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Government they might, beſides this, have reap'd this advantage, to have been always aſſured of his Majeſty's powerful Protection, which they ſtood ſo much in need of.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:65930:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>At the ſame time one <hi>la Salle,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman</hi> by birth, but a Creature of the Cardinal of <hi>Furſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> was Governour of the Cittadel of <hi>Liege.</hi> The new Prince offer'd to continue him in his Poſt, which he refus'd to accept of, but choſe rather to follow the Cardinal's Fortune, who was now making all the neceſſary preparations, to defend himſelf and his Right upon the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cologne</hi> by force of Arms. For, tho' his Holineſs being prepoſſeſs'd with prejudice and paſſion, had excluded him from his pretenſions upon this Arch-Biſhoprick, our King, who was reſolv'd to maintain the Cardinal in his Right, did not think fit, he ſhould reſt ſatisfied with this determination of the Pope. For which reaſon, he ſent a conſiderable number of his Troops to his aſſiſtance, moſt of which were put in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in the places of Strength in his poſſeſſion, who were alſo provided with able <hi>French</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Commanders. Thus the War began to be rekindl'd upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> at the ſame time, when on another ſide, vaſt preparations were making for a deſcent in <hi>England,</hi> which produc'd that famous Revolution, which ſoon after happen'd in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerv'd, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> finding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation extreamly diſſatify'd with their King, not only as he was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> but becauſe they were ſenſible, he endeavour'd to ſettle that Religion there, in oppoſition to the eſtabliſh'd Religion and the Laws of the Kingdom; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to improve this opportunity, made a deſcent upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, with a good Army, where he was receiv'd with open Arms.

to the Throne. without making uſe of any violent means, and that he believ'd the King's preſence might prove an obſtacle to his Intentions. Thus this Monarch made his eſcape out of <hi>England</hi> and came into <hi>France,</hi> where the Queen his Spouſe was arriv'd before him, with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Count <hi>de Lauſun.</hi> This young Prince, who was then but a ſucking Child, had ever ſince he came out of his Mother's Womb, been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the frailty of all humane Affairs, and that we are born to ſufferings in this World. For, it had been given out by ſome that he was a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Child, by others, that he was indeed the Queen's Son, but begotten by a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Revolution, ever ſince the time he found the King of <hi>England</hi> bent, upon the eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion in that Kingdom, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in his Quarrel ſeveral Princes and States, who being jealous of the Glory of <hi>France,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of our King's Arms, were willing to favour a deſign, which they knew would embroil the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Prince had ſucceeded in his deſign, even beyond the Expectation of thoſe who had ſided with him all the Proteſtant States in <hi>Europe</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd him for King of <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> and tho' it might have been reaſonably expected, that the Intereſt of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, which then lay at Stake, ſhould have been prevailing enough with the Emperor and <hi>Spain,</hi> to prefer it before the Jealouſie they had conceiv'd at the greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> yet they follow'd in this point without delay, the footſteps of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes.</p>
               <p>This was like the Alarm to our King, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order'd his Troops to beſiege <hi>Philipsburgh,</hi> and ſome other Places in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> this prov'd the occaſion of the late War betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the Confederates, who tho' of very different Sentiments, both in point of Religion and States Intereſt, enter'd into a League, to carry on the War againſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct

the growing greatneſs of our King: The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts were ſo ſucceſsful, as to make themſelves Maſters of the whole Electorate of <hi>Cologne</hi> the next following Campaign, and beſides this, beſieg'd the City of <hi>Mayence,</hi> the Capital of the Arch-Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, which bears that Name, under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> the Imperial General. The <hi>Dauphin</hi> had, towards the latter end of the laſt Year, made himſelf Maſter of this place without any reſiſtance, after he had taken <hi>Philipsburgh;</hi> but it coſt the Imperial Army a Siege of ſix Weeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great many of their beſt Men, before they could bring the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon to a Capitulation? and it was generally believ'd, that they would have been forc'd to raiſe the Siege, if the place had been ſufficiently provided with every thing, requiſite for a long and vigorous defence.</p>
               <p>I told you before upon what account it was, I did not think fit to ſerve at the Siege of <hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> but the caſe being alter'd ſince, and finding there was probability enough, that the War, which was likely to ſpread over the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> would not come to a ſudden period, I once more left the Country, and no ſooner appear'd at Court, but I offer'd my Service to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> being introduc'd to him by the Marqueſs <hi>de Livri.</hi> This Gentleman told the Chief Miniſter, in what Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I had ſerv'd in <hi>Germany;</hi> and I had brought my Commiſſions along with me, which ſtood me in good ſtead. For the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> deſir'd to ſee them, and after he had perus'd them, he told me, the King intended to make me a Leiutenant Colonel over a <hi>German</hi> Regiment. But it was not very long before he chang'd his reſolution; for, the very next time I came to pay my reſpects to this Miniſter of State, he told me, that the King's intention was to ſend me into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that inſtead of a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonel's Commiſſion, I ſhould be made Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadeer of Horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65930:85"/>Two Kinſmen of mine, whoſe Names were <hi>Vignol</hi> and <hi>Foreſt,</hi> had much about the ſame time taken Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the King's Army, and the Regiments they ſerv'd in were then in <hi>France;</hi> but underſtanding that I was to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> they had ſo much kindneſs for me, as to deſire likewiſe to be employ'd in that Kingdom. I did all I could to diſſwade them from it; I repreſented to them, that there was but little likelihood of any conſiderable advantage in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Service, at ſo great a diſtance from home; but all in vain, for they were reſolv'd I ſhould owe them this Obligation, that they had ſacrific'd their Intereſt to our Friendſhip. The Marqueſs <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois</hi> having granted their Requeſt, the firſt had a Captain's Commiſſion beſtow'd upon him, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of a Lieutenant, both of Horſe.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſet out all three together from <hi>Paris,</hi> and I appointed them a certain day, when without fail, they were to be at <hi>Samur;</hi> becauſe I had receiv'd po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Orders from the Chief Miniſter, not to carry above twice four and twenty Hours at my own home, and to proceed from thence forthwith in my Journey to <hi>Nants,</hi> where I ſhould meet with many more Officers, who had ſerv'd in the King's Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and were now order'd, as well as my ſelf, to embark with all poſſible ſpeed for <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I met my two Kinſmen at the appointed day and place, and we embark'd immediately in a Veſſel at <hi>Samur,</hi> which carried us in two days to <hi>Nants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Chauneſs</hi> to whom I paid a Viſit, told me, That thoſe Officers who came lately out of <hi>Catalonia</hi> were gone two Days before to <hi>Pimbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouf,</hi> from whence they intended to go forward with the firſt fair Wind to <hi>Breſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where Monſieur <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau Renault</hi> lay ready to ſet Still with a good Fleet; and that we muſt not neglect a Minutes time, if we intended to take the opportunity of this Fleet, to be tranſported into <hi>Ireland.</hi> We follow'd his Advice as much as poſſibly we could, and embark'd the next Morning early, in hopes to meet with theſe <hi>Cataloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> Officers ſtill at <hi>Pimboouf;</hi> but they had not carry'd
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65930:85"/>
there at all, but had immediately after their arrival, hired another Veſſel to carry them forthwith to <hi>Breſt,</hi> for fear they ſhould loſe the advantage of the Wind, which blew very fair for them. And the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel proved that they had been much in the right, for within four and twenty Hours after, the Wind chop'd about, and continued contrary to us for twelve Days together; all which time we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſpend in vain, and with a great deal of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; at laſt the Wind turn'd on our ſide, and you may believe we would not loſe a Minute, ſo with a fair Gale we ſailed for <hi>Breſt;</hi> but were no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, but that to our great Surprize we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the Fleet commanded by Monſieur <hi>de Chateau Renault</hi> had ſet Sail for <hi>Ireland</hi> the very Night before, our arrival there.</p>
               <p>This Fleet had on Board above two Hundred <hi>French</hi> Officers, beſides a great quantity of Proviſion and Ammunition, all which was intended to ſupport the War in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> who was Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at the time of the great Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> had not ſided with his Enemies, as moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> had done; but behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a faithful Subject, and by his Conduct pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> in his Maſter's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not without hopes this might prove a means for him to recover his other two Kingdoms. For this purpoſe, as ſoon as he got intelligence of what had happened in <hi>England,</hi> he had given Commiſſions to moſt of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Gentlemen of the Country, to raiſe Men for their King's Service; and thoſe who were ſenſible, that their Ruine depended on that of their Royal Maſter. ſhew'd a great deal of Zeal, to give him the utmoſt of their Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>A great Number of the Inhabitants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who were <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> foreſeeing that the War was likely to be carried on with extraordinary Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity in that Kingdom, and fearing, not without reaſon, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would take this opportunity to take ſatisfaction from them for a great many Affronts
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65930:86"/>
and Damages received from the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whilſt they were the ſtrongeſt Party, retired in time into <hi>England</hi> with their Effects: But thoſe who had their Eſtates in Land, were forced to ſtay behind, and promiſed to be faithful to the King.</p>
               <p>Moſt of theſe laſt lived in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Londonderry</hi> and <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> which were as yet in the Hands of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but the Earl of <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel,</hi> who did put but a ſlender confidence in their Faith, ordered ſome <hi>Catholick</hi> Regiments thither, to keep a watchful Eye over them. But the implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred which has always been moſt conſpicuous in that Kingdom, betwixt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> began ſoon to break out into great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. To remedy which, my Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Proteſtant</hi> Lord, whoſe Eſtate lay thereabouts, did all he could to perſwade the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> that he had taken wrong Meaſures, thus to diſcover to all the World, the Diffidence he had of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Party, and that it would be much ſafer for him to leave the Defence of theſe two Places to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alone, than to two Parties which would be always thwarting one another, being of ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Principle, tho at the ſame time it was certain, that he underhand fomented theſe Diviſions among them. Nevertheleſs the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> follow'd his Advice, but no ſooner had he withdrawn the <hi>Catholick</hi> Troops from thence, but the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thereabouts revolted unanimouſly againſt the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl gave immediate notice of it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in <hi>France,</hi> and poſitively told him in his Letter, That his Preſence was abſolutely neceſſary in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He ſent word alſo, That he ſhrewdly ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi>'s Conduct, eſpecially ſince his two Sons were gone over with their Regiment to the Enemy and that his Opinion was, it would not be long before he would follow in Perſon, unleſs he were prevented. His Advice was to ſend for him into <hi>France,</hi> under pretence that the King would conſult with him concerning ſome Matters of great Moment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65930:86"/>
relating to that Kingdom, and to ſecure him there. It was alſo contrived, that the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> ſhould give my Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> Letters to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in which he ſhould recommend his Conduct and Zeal for the King's Intereſt, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſguiſe their deſign againſt him, which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the fair Contents of theſe Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory Letters, was to be put in execution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his Arrival in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> did communicate <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Letter and Advice to our King, who was of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he ought to follow the Earls Counſel, and appear in Perſon in <hi>Ireland,</hi> promiſing him powerful aſſiſtance both of Men and Money, beſides all other Neceſſaries for the carrying on of this Enterprize.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, my Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> being ſent for, came to St. <hi>Germains</hi> freighted with ſham Letters of Recommendation from the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> to the King of <hi>England;</hi> with whom he had a long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and it was obſerved that the King mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the matter ſo well on his ſide, that my Lord did not in the leaſt miſtruſt, what was likely to befall him. But very few days were paſs'd, before he was undeceiv'd in the matter, for no ſooner had his <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanick</hi> Majeſty had a full account from his own Mouth, concerning the true State of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was the only thing he wanted to know at that time, but he caus'd him to be ſecur'd and carried to the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> where at firſt he had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted him to walk in the Court, but afterwards was confin'd to a Room under Lock and Key, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) had confin'd <hi>Hamilton</hi> to a cloſe Priſon.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> took along with him for <hi>Ireland</hi> Monſieur <hi>Roſe,</hi> an experienc'd Officer, who was to Command his Army there; and our King furniſh'd him, with ſeveral other Officers of Note, they being moſt of all wanted in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſomewhat ſtrange to relate, but nevertheleſs very true, that tho' there were many among the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who had ſerv'd before, yet were they generally
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65930:87"/>
ſuch Novices in the Art of War, that it was a rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to find one among them, who was capable of Commanding a Company of Foot. The Count <hi>de Avaux</hi> was choſen by our King, to attend his <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniok</hi> Majeſty, as his Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, and they arriv'd ſafely at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> gave the King an account by word of Mouth, concerning thoſe Matters he had imparted to him before in Writing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Council of his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, who was infected with that Natural Hatred the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> as it may be ſaid, ſuck with their Mother's Milk, againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> could not without a ſecret Envy, brook the Praiſes and Honours the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> beſtow'd upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> for their Loyalty. It was for this reaſon they repreſented to the King, that the Earl had overdone the Buſineſs, that there needed not above half that Number he had put in Arms, they wanting both Money and Magazines for their Subſiſtence; and that in caſe they were not disbanded, they would be forc'd to disband them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> did oppoſe it as much as he could, alledging that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops, being accuſtom'd to live hardy, would ſtand the King in little; that by degrees they might be made ſerviceable; and that upon all occaſions they would be ready to be Commanded, where ever the King ſhould think fit; but his Advice, tho' much the better of the two, was over-rul'd by the others.</p>
               <p>The next thing that came in debate was, for the King to appear in Perſon before <hi>London-derry;</hi> the place being provided with a ſtrong Garriſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to defend it to the laſt extremity: Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Roſe</hi> was againſt it, and gave very convincing Reaſons for his Opinion; He told them, that it was a great piece of Imprudence, ſo ruſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly to expoſe the Reputation of his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty in the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, that it would be much the ſecurer way to have a little patience, till they were ſupply'd with Arms and Ammunition from <hi>France,</hi> there being not above 4000 then, who were duly provided with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65930:87"/>
Arms; and that if they appear'd in that poſture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town, they would be only laugh'd at by the Rebels. But all his perſwaſions were in vain; and my Lord <hi>Melfort</hi> gave him for Anſwer, that this Rabble would for the moſt part diſperſe, as ſoon as they did but hear, that his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty was upon the March againſt them; and that the reſt would come half ways, to lay the Keys of their Gates at his Feet.</p>
               <p>Princes are as inclinable to be led away by flattery as other People, and it was this, that made the King of <hi>England</hi> yield to their pernicious Counſel. Accordingly the Army directed its March toward <hi>Strabane,</hi> where they paſs'd the River in ſight of the Rebels, who were advanc'd that way, to endeavour to diſpute our Paſſage. But they retiring into the Town, we follow'd them as careleſly, as if we had been Marching to an undoubted Conqueſt, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſable they appear'd to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Council: But in lieu of laying the Keys of their Gates at His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Feet, as they had fooliſhly perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were infinitely ſurpriz'd, when we were ſaluted with the great Cannon from the City. General <hi>Roſe</hi> ask'd then my Lord <hi>Melfort</hi> what was to be done now, we wanting great Artillery to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Salute: But we were too far Engag'd to Retire, without expoſing the King's Reputation; wherefore, it was reſolv'd to block up the Place, till a more convenient opportunity; and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd in the mean while made ſtrong Entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to hinder our approach, in caſe of a formal Siege.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) having notice given him of what paſs'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that Monſieur <hi>de Chateau-Renault</hi> was expected there with a ſtrong Convoy, order'd a Fleet to be equipp'd to intercept his Paſſage. This Fleet put to Sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting its Courſe towards <hi>Kingſale,</hi> which was in danger of having been ſurpriz'd by them, if the Governour of the place had not prevented it by his Conduct. Thus the Enemies Fleet ſtood off of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65930:88"/>
                  <hi>Kingſale,</hi> expecting the coming of Monſieur <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau-Renault,</hi> whom they intended to attack, as he was going into that Port, whither they knew he was bound; and it fail'd but little, but that he had fall'n into their Hands, being ignorant that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Fleet was at Sea; if he had not been forewarn'd at about Ten Leagues diſtance from the Port, by ſome Signals made from the Shoar, that the Enemy was near the Port, which made him change his Courſe, and to put in into <hi>Bantry-Bay.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> having ſoon got notice of it, attack'd him in the Bay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had quite unloaden our Ships; but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Chateau-Renault</hi> being well prepar'd for their Reception, and having the advantage of the Wind, made them retire; and if he had not been under a neceſſity of protecting his Tranſport Ships, which were not as yet all in ſafety, he might have purſu'd them with ſome advantage. He judg'd it therefore moſt expedient, to reſt ſatisfi'd with what he had done; tho' ſome at Court, who look'd with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Eye upon his Glory, did take this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to cenſure this Action, ſome attributing it to his want of Experience, ſome to his want of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but they were forc'd to draw in their Pipes when he appear'd at Court in Perſon, and gave the King all imaginable Demonſtrations of his great Conduct in this Engagement.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſpent my time at <hi>Breſt</hi> with a great deal of diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I addreſs'd my ſelf to the Marſhal <hi>de Eſtres,</hi> deſiring him to order me a Veſſel to tranſport me to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Within three Days after, there came above a Hundred Officers more to <hi>Breſt,</hi> who being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſign'd for that Kingdom, the Marſhal writ about it to the Marqueſs <hi>de Signelai,</hi> but receiv'd no anſwer, ſo that we were forc'd to wait with Patience, till further Orders from Court. I then took a reſolution to go to <hi>Camaret,</hi> becauſe I found my ſelf not very well at <hi>Breſt,</hi> and my Phyſicians advis'd me to change the Air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65930:88"/>Being therefore fully reſolv'd to go thither, I ſpoke of it to ſome of the reſt of the Officers, who being alſo of opinion, that perhaps we might meet with a Veſſel there, that would carry us to <hi>Ireland,</hi> were willing to go along with me thither.</p>
               <p>As I am very apt to forecaſt Matters, and that I was afraid we ſhould have but a very dull time of it there, if we ſhould be forc'd to wait for an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being Tranſported into <hi>Ireland:</hi> I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to meet with one whom I had known in <hi>Paris,</hi> and who was lately come to <hi>Breſt</hi> about the King's Buſineſs; I ask'd him what Diverſion there was at <hi>Camaret,</hi> for knowing that his Buſineſs ſometimes call'd him that way, I was ſure he could give me an account of the Place. He told me, it was my own fault, if I could not paſs my time pleaſantly at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret,</hi> there being a certain Lady there, whoſe Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was a Man of great Buſineſs, who did nothing elſe but ſeek how to divert herſelf; but that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he would adviſe me, to have a care not to fall in Love with her, for he believ'd her not to be of that ſtamp. I was overjoy'd to meet with ſo much encouragement, which made me embark with the reſt of the Officers, that were to be of our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, forthwith to <hi>Camaret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had ſcarce ſet a Foot a ſhoar, when the Lady, whoſe Name was Madam . . . . . . ſent a Footman, to deſire us in her and her Husband's Name, to come the ſame Evening to take a Supper with them.</p>
               <p>You may believe we had more Wit and good Breeding, than to refuſe ſo favourable an Offer in a place, where we were afraid before, we ſhould have been kill'd with Melancholy; to be ſhort, we were very handſomly entertain'd at Supper, which being done, ſhe deſir'd four of us (of which I was one) to take up our Lodgings at her Houſe.</p>
               <p>This Lady was a great <hi>Coquette,</hi> pleaſing enough in her Converſation; and as I am one of thoſe, who are eaſily caught in the ſnare, I fell in Love with her the very firſt time I ſaw her. As my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was not to tarry long in this place, ſo I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65930:89"/>
thought it beſt to make quick work of it, and ſo declared my Paſſion to her the next day. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo little ſtartled at my declaration of Love, that I was in good hopes we ſhould ſoon come to a Capitulation, but tho' I ply'd her very hard for eight days together (as long as I ſtay'd in the Houſe) yet I could not bring her to my Bow, which made me remember what my Friend had told me concerning her at <hi>Breſt;</hi> and I began to be ſenſible, that ſhe was one of thoſe Fantaſtical Creatures, who rather love to be Admir'd and Courted, than to be Kiſs'd.</p>
               <p>However, I flatter'd my ſelf, that her refuſal might in a great meaſure, proceed from the little acquaintance we had as yet, in hopes, that after my return out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I might have the ſame op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſee her again, and renew the Siege at better leiſure; and ſhe was ſo generous as to tell me at parting, that ſhe ſhould never forget me.</p>
               <p>To confeſs the truth, I was not very forward to leave a place, where I had a Miſtriſs in whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted ſo much; but there happening juſt at that time to come a ſmall Veſſel to <hi>Camaret,</hi> the Maſter of which offer'd, to tranſport us into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for threeſcore Piſtols, I writ to the Marſhal <hi>de Eſtrees</hi> to furniſh us with a Paſs, without which, the Maſter durſt not venture to go. The Marſhal refus'd to ſend us a Paſs, either becauſe he would not do it without Expreſs Orders from Monſieur <hi>de Segnelai,</hi> or becauſe he fear'd, that if we ſhould be taken by the Enemy, he might be call'd to an account for it. Thus the Bargain came to nothing, but to prevent the like inconveniency for the future, I writ about it in the Name of all the reſt, to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt we liv'd in expectation of an anſwer, there happen'd an odd Accident to one of my familiar Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who then Commanded a Batallion of the Regiment of <hi>la Fere,</hi> which turn'd at laſt to his great advantage. There was at that time an Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two Thouſand Men, in the incloſures call'd <hi>la Brouſaille,</hi> about half a League from <hi>Breſt;</hi> and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65930:89"/>
as he march'd with his Batalion through <hi>Morlaix,</hi> in his way to the Camp, four Soldiers of his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being got Drunk, and underſtanding that the Maid of the Houſe, where they were Quarter'd, would now and then take up with a good Fellow, were alſo for trying their Fortune with her. But whether the Maid was not in the humour at that time, or that ſhe was afraid of them, ſhe would not receive their Courtſhip, ſo that without more ado they raviſh'd her. But this was not all, for they ſet fire to the Houſes, and ſo away they went. Complaints were made of this Outrage to their Captain, who being ſenſible it was a Crime of ſo high a nature as would not paſs unpuniſh'd, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd them to the Provoſt. But unwilling to part with theſe four Soldiers, whom he knew to be the beſt in the whole Company, and conſidering that it was exceſs of Drink that had drawn them into this Miſdemeanour, he was contriving how to ſave their Lives.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he prevail'd ſo far upon the Provoſt, that he promis'd him no farther proceedings ſhould be made againſt them, till he had ſpoke with, and try'd whether they could come to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Parties concern'd. The Wench, who was not ſo nice of her Reputation, but that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it might be repair'd by a little Money, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of a Preſent, and deny'd what ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd concerning the Rape before. The Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than a miſerable Cottage, was likewiſe paid for to the Owners, ſo that there being neither Accuſers nor Witneſſes againſt the Soldiers, and the Provoſt being likewiſe their Friend,, they were Diſcharg'd and ſent back to their Captain, at the Camp of <hi>Brouſſaille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the Matter could not be carried on with ſo much ſecrecy, but that the Criminal Judges of <hi>Morlaix</hi> had got ſome ſcent of the Matter. They could not reliſh very well, that the Provoſt ſhould carry off the Booty alone, without their having a ſhare in it, which made them make their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65930:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Monſieur <hi>de Pommerevil,</hi> Intendant of that Province. This Monſieur <hi>de Pommerevil,</hi> being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe natural Diſpoſition tends to ſeverity, did look upon this Crime as of ſo heinous a Nature, as ought not to paſs unpuniſh'd, without impairing God's Juſtice; which made him haſten to <hi>Breſt,</hi> where the firſt thing he did, was to Summon my Friend to appear before him. For you muſt know, that the Officers belonging to this Body of 12000 Men, had their Quarters aſſign'd them at <hi>Breſt,</hi> and were only upon Duty in the Camp, in their ſeveral turns.</p>
               <p>This Captain, who was a Man of Senſe, had been ſo cunning, as to take, before he left <hi>Morlaix,</hi> a Certificate from the Magiſtracy, of the good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of his Soldiers, during their ſtay there; as alſo a Copy of the Information exhibited againſt theſe Four Soldiers, after the accommodation of the Buſineſs with the Parties concern'd, upon which they had been diſcharg'd by the Provoſt. Nay, he did more than this; for, as ſoon as they were put into the Provoſt's Hands, he writ to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and gave him an Account, how he had cauſed four of his Soldiers, accus'd of a Rape and other enormous Crimes, to be committed to Priſon, but, that upon a more ſtrict Information, they had been found not guilty of what was laid to their Charge. The Intendant ſent one <hi>Hoqueton,</hi> to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Captain to appear before him; but the Captain relying upon his Intereſt with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> ſent the Intendant Word, that he was a little out of Order at preſent, and could not ſtir abroad; beſides, that he did not remember any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he had with the Intendant, but if he had any with him, he deſir'd him to come to him.</p>
               <p>This was an unexpected Complement to Monſieur <hi>de Pommerevil,</hi> who did not imagine that my Friend durſt have made thus bold with him; but he who knew the Marſhal <hi>de Eſtrees</hi> to be upon the ſpot, did put no great value upon the Intendant's Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Monſieur <hi>de Pommerevil,</hi> who was no leſs ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65930:90"/>
of the Marſhal's Prerogative, did think it moſt adviſeable to make his Applications to him; which he did accordingly, and requir'd that theſe Four Soldiers might be taken into Cuſtody again: The Marſhal who was reſolv'd not to loſe an Inch of his Authority, told him, that he would ſend for the Captain, who ſhould deliver up the Four Soldiers into his Hands; which being done accordingly, the Intendant committed them for the preſent to the Gaol of <hi>Breſt,</hi> till he could have them convey'd to <hi>Morlaix,</hi> where he intended to have them ſeverely puniſh'd. In the mean while my Friend writ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to Inform him of what had paſs'd; but before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Anſwer from that Miniſter, he put another Affront upon the Intendant, which he reliſh'd worſe than the firſt, and would have made him feel the effects of his Anger, if the Marſhal <hi>de Eſtrees</hi> had not been ſo near at Hand.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, the Intendant ſent to my Friend, to let him have ſome Soldiers with an under Officer, to Conduct the beforementioned Priſoners to <hi>Morlaix;</hi> but he ſent him word, that he did not ſtand under his Command, neither would obey his Orders; that his Soldiers were to ſerve the King, and not him; with this he went to the Marſhal, unto whom he gave an account of the Matter, and how the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant would have put upon him, as well as upon the Authority of the Marſhal, whoſe Orders he was ready to Obey, if he thought fit he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach a Party for that purpoſe. The Marſhal told him, that he had done what he ought to do, in having refuſed theſe Men, and that he order'd him to do it again, if he did give him another ſuch like occaſion. Monſieur <hi>de Pommereville</hi> finding the Captain back'd by the Marſhal, was forc'd to reſt ſatisfied, and the Captain gain'd the good will of all the Officers of the Army, for his boldneſs, to dare to make head alone, againſt the Intendant of the Province, Within a few days after, Monſieur <hi>de Pommereville</hi> receiv'd an Anſwer from the Marquiſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65930:91"/>
                  <hi>de Louvois,</hi> upon his Letter writ upon that Subject to the ſaid Miniſter, which was no ſmall addition to his Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, the Captain had been ſo vigilant, as by his reiterated Letters, to repreſent to the ſaid Miniſter, that the Intendant acted in this point, more out of a motive of Envy and Paſſion, than love of Juſtice, (the Soldiers having been diſcharg'd by due courſe of Law before) which made the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> order the Intendant not to meddle any further in the matter.</p>
               <p>I receiv'd, much about the ſame time, Orders from the ſaid Miniſter, to Embark with all the reſt of the Officers, who were ready to go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the firſt Veſſel I could meet with. At the ſame time Monſieur <hi>de Gerſe</hi> (who was likewiſe to go for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) was expected at <hi>Breſt,</hi> which made ſeveral of the Officers that were with me at <hi>Camaret</hi> leave us, and return to <hi>Breſt,</hi> imagining (and not without reaſon) that by reaſon of his near relation to the Marqueſs <hi>de Segnelay,</hi> he would be provided with a good Convoy to facilitate his Paſſage thither. If I had been as wiſe as I ought to have been, I ſhould have done as they did; but conſidering that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Gerſe</hi> was not come as yet to <hi>Breſt,</hi> and that it would coſt me a great deal of Money there, to expect his coming; what with Covetouſneſs, and what with Love, I was not ſo careful as I ought to have been of my own ſafety. There were alſo ſeveral Officers who, tho' Love had not the leaſt ſhare in their Reſolution, for fear of ſpending their Money at <hi>Breſt</hi> reſolv'd to take the ſame Courſe as I did.</p>

               <head>THE MEMOIRS OF JOHN BAPTIST <hi>De La Fontaine,</hi> Kt. LIB. V.</head>
               <p>THE Maſter of the Veſſel, who, as I told you before, was to have Tranſported us from <hi>Camaret</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his Bargain for want of a Paſs, had left this Port, which made us take a Reſolution to go to <hi>Croiſil,</hi> where as we were certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, we could not miſs of a Veſſel fit for our purpoſe, which indeed prov'd true; for, we were no ſooner arriv'd there, but we met with one, which was lately come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having taken in her Cargo of Salt, was juſt ready to ſet Sail again for that Kingdom. Thus we Embark'd; but at our going out of that Port, (the Entrance of which is very difficult) we were in great danger of being loſt; there being a very dangerous Rock, upon which many Veſſels ſplit in pieces, and we were in the utmoſt hazard to have run upon it, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of our Pilot, who was drunk. As good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would have it, it was low Tide, and no Wind
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65930:92"/>
ſtirring, ſo that with the next high Tide, we got clear of that dangerous Rock. This Siniſter Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſeem'd to be an ill <hi>Omen</hi> of what befell us hereafter; for the very firſt Night we were by a moſt furious Tempeſt, driven near the Coaſt of <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> where we caſt Anchor, and being ſhelter'd from the Wind, remain'd there two Days. The Storm being ſomewhat abated we ſet ſail again, but were the ſame Night overtaken again by another Tempeſt, which laſted whole twelve Days, during which time, having been toſs'd up and down along the Coaſt, we were at laſt forc'd among the Rocks in <hi>Conquet</hi> Road.</p>
               <p>My Advice was to make the Port of <hi>Camaret,</hi> where we might buy us ſome freſh Proviſions, the greateſt part of what we had taken along with us, being conſumed already; ſo that if we ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet with another diſappointment by reaſon of the Winds or otherwiſe, we might be in great danger of want of Victuals. But the other Officers, who had been before with me at <hi>Camaret,</hi> and had a ſuſpicion, that I had a more than ordinary Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Madam . . . . . whom I ſpoke of before, imagining that this Advice of mine proceeded, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the great inclination I had to ſee her, than from any conſideration of our neceſſity, were againſt it; and their Surlineſs prov'd the occaſion of that Misfortune, which befel us not long after: For, if we had made that Port, we ſhould queſtionleſs have been advertis'd, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets were come to the height of the <hi>Weſtſand,</hi> to Attack Monſieur <hi>de Tourville</hi> in his return from the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean.</hi> They were alſo to prevent the Squadron deſign'd for <hi>Ireland,</hi> from coming out of <hi>Breſt,</hi> and they were at that time much concern'd at Court, which way thoſe that were intended for that Service, ſhould avoid meeting with them.</p>
               <p>But which way ſoever the reſt eſcap'd their Hands, our Veſſel, it ſeems, could not avoid her deſtiny. For the next Morning early, we found our ſelves in ſight of the whole Fleet of the Enemy, who had
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65930:92"/>
no ſooner deſcry'd us, but they ſent Seven or Eight Ships in purſuit of our Veſſel, and four more, of which there eſcaped but one, the reſt all fell into their Hands. The <hi>Greenwich,</hi> a Man of War of Sixty Guns took us, and the Captain order'd us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be carried on board of his Ship. They were ſo civil as not to ſtrip us, but they took all the Money we had, and what elſe belong'd to us. After the Captain had perus'd my Commiſſion, and found what Poſt I ſerv'd in, he order'd me to Dine with him at his Table; which gave me ſo much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as to deſire him to let me have my Quilt; he anſwer'd me, the Quilt was as yet in the Ship in which we had been taken, and that all what was in his power to do for me at the preſent was, to ſend me on board of it again, to take the Conveniency of it there. I return'd him thanks, and he did me the favour, to give leave to three more of our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to go along with me, when we were come into the Ship, we found that they had taken all the <hi>French</hi> Seamen out of her, and had put <hi>Engliſh</hi> in their places.</p>
               <p>This Veſſel being very heavy loaden, could not keep up with the Fleet, but was in the Morning at break of Day, about a Mile diſtant from the reſt. One Captain <hi>Newburgh,</hi> who Commanded a ſtout <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War, happen'd to be neareſt to her, and not knowing her to be a Prize, was in hopes of making her his; with this intention he came up with us, early in the Morning, and having ſent a Sloop on board, they examin'd the Seamen from whence the Veſſel came, and whither bound; the Seamen call'd a Sergeant, who was to guard the Ship, to give an account of the matter, which he did accordingly; but becauſe he had no Orders in Writing, and they would not take his Word, Captain <hi>Newburgh</hi> made himſelf Maſter of the Ship. He ſent however ſoon after to the Captain of the <hi>Greenwich,</hi> to know whether ſhe were his Prize, and being given to underſtand that ſhe was ſo, he immediately took his Seamen out of her again. In
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65930:93"/>
three Hours after, the Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, unto whom they had ſhewn my Commiſſion, did ſend for me, and ſeveral others of the <hi>French</hi> Officers, that had been taken with me, on board his Ship, where we were extreamly civilly receiv'd, and invited to Dine with the Admiral. This Lord had been in great eſteem with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and had had a conſiderable Place in his Court; but the King being reſolv'd afterwards not to entertain any but <hi>Catholicks</hi> in his Court, he ſent for him, and told him, that he muſt either quit his Place, or change his Religion. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral chuſing the firſt, retir'd into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was very Inſtrumental in laying the Foundation of that great Revolution, which ſince happen'd in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt we ſat at Table, our Diſcourſe run upon ſeveral different Subjects, but among the reſt upon the Misfortune which had ſo lately befal'n the King of <hi>England;</hi> Upon which, Mr. <hi>Greenville,</hi> who was Captain of a Man of War, was ſo bold as to ſay, That, <hi>if King</hi> James <hi>had turn'd my Lord</hi> Torring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>out the Doors, he had been even with him ſince, for he had turn'd him out of three Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before Dinner was over, Advice was brought to my Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> that they had juſt then taken one of the <hi>French</hi> King's Friggots, call'd the <hi>Wanton,</hi> carrying 36 Guns. She was Commanded by one <hi>Picard,</hi> a Gentleman of Fortune, who had defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with incredible Bravery, from three a Clock in the Morning, till one in the Afternoon, againſt Eight of the Enemies Ships. There was not one there, but what applauded his Courage; and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who otherwiſe are the moſt jealous People in the World, and were Eye-witneſſes of our Action, could not forbear to give him all the Praiſes due to his Merits.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> then Rear-Admiral of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Din'd with us at the ſame time. He had been in <hi>France</hi> ſome Years before, and I became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> where we happen'd to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65930:93"/>
Lodge in the ſame Inn, as did likewiſe Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi> Underſtanding that they Intended in a few Days to go to <hi>Paris.</hi> I deſir'd them, that in their way, they would call at my Houſe in the Country, which they did, and ſtay'd with me a whole Week, during which time, I entertain'd them, as well as my Circumſtances would permit. They no ſooner ſaw me, but knew me again, and after they had paid me all the imaginable Civilities, Mr. <hi>Greenville</hi> was pleas'd to tell me, let come of it what would, he muſt have me on board with him, which being as ſoon granted as ask'd, we went not long after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on board his Ship; where I had not been many Hours, but he began to entertain me concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affairs of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and to uſe many Perſwaſions to bring me over to his ſide. He knew that I had ſerv'd for a conſiderable time among the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> which doubtleſs gave him the more Encouragement to believe, that it would be no difficult matter, to perſwade me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his Propoſals. I anſwer'd him, that when I conſider'd thoſe extraordinary marks of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he had honour'd me with, both when he was in <hi>France</hi> ſome Years ago, and now again within theſe few Hours, I had all the reaſon in the World to perſwade my ſelf, that he was my real Friend; but that, conſidering what Advice he was pleas'd to give me at this time, I could not but be afraid, I had flatter'd my ſelf too ſoon. That if he would take my word, I could aſſure him, that I was not likely to be what he would have me, and that he did me wrong, if he entertain'd any other thought of me. He anſwer'd me, that if he had not been my Friend, he ſhould ſcarce have made me ſuch an Offer; that <hi>France</hi> was not in a condition to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo many Enemies, as had declar'd War againſt it; and that it was but Prudence for me to engage my ſelf on the ſtrongeſt ſide. I told him again, that he did not conſider very well what he ſaid, as to this Point; that <hi>France</hi> was more powerful than all thoſe Enemies, that were Engag'd in a League againſt it;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65930:94"/>
but this being not the matter in diſpute betwixt us, I would take it for granted to be ſo, I was a Subject of the <hi>French</hi> King, I had my Eſtate, Wife and Children in that Kingdom, all which were ſuch ſtrong ties, as indiſpenſably oblig'd me to ſpend my laſt drop of Blood in his Service. He anſwer'd me, as to what concern'd my Eſtate, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (unto whom he gave the Title of King of <hi>England</hi>) had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Generoſity enough, to give me double Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the loſs of it; and for my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I need not fear, there being means enough to have them convey'd into <hi>England,</hi> when ever I thought fit to have them there with me.</p>
               <p>Here we broke off our Diſcourſe for this time, but the next Day my Lord <hi>B</hi> . . . . . came to Dine with him on board his Ship, when they began to reaſſume the ſaid Theme, and both joined in their Perſwaſions to bring me over to their Party. I then pretended to liſten to their Advice, the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection I made, being about my Eſtate in <hi>France,</hi> which I could not reſolve to leave behind: My reaſon why I thus ply'd the Hypocrite was, becauſe I did not queſtion, but that by this means I ſhould be able by degrees, to dive into their Deſigns, and conſequently, to do a moſt ſignal piece of Service to our King. My Lord <hi>B</hi> . . . . . then ſpoke to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, much to the ſame purpoſe as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Greenville</hi> had done the day before, <hi>to wit,</hi> that I need not in the leaſt queſtion, but that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) would beſtow upon me ſuch marks of his Favour, as would give me not the leaſt occaſion to think of what I had loſt in <hi>France.</hi> Afterwards, he Invited us againſt next day, to Dine with him on board his Ship, where they began to repeat their former Inſtances, with many other Reaſons, which they believ'd might induce me to embrace their Advice. At laſt I feign'd to be overcome by their Perſwaſions, and told them, that provided the Prince (King <hi>William</hi> III.) ſhould think fit, to give me ſuch a reception as they had promis'd me, I would enter into his Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65930:94"/>My Lord <hi>T</hi> . . . . . was no ſooner advis'd of their ſuppos'd Succeſs, but he order'd I ſhould come on board him the ſame Day. We Din'd there all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after Dinner he took us three aſide, and told me in their preſence, that what theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had told me concerning the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) he would engage his Honour upon; that I my ſelf would be charm'd with his generous deportment, as ſoon as I ſhould but ſee him; that he was the Darling of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as of others, being generally belov'd by all; that the moſt convincing proof could be given of it was, that he had open'd his way to the Throne, without any effuſion of Blood, and that the People of <hi>England</hi> had poſitively demanded him for their King; that, as by degrees he ſhould ſee himſelf eſtabliſh'd in the Throne, he would give every Day more glorious proofs of his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to his Friends, becauſe he would be in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition to do it. I pretended to be overcome by his Arguments, and to yield to all that he told me; ſo that being as much deceiv'd in me as the reſt, did give notice of it to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.)</p>
               <p>Whilſt this was in agitation betwixt us, my Lord <hi>Torrington</hi> receiv'd Intelligence, that the Count <hi>de Tourville</hi> was with the <hi>French Mediterranean</hi> Squadron arriv'd in the Road of <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> which made him take up his Station betwixt <hi>Bell-Iſle</hi> and <hi>Breſt,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the <hi>French</hi> Fleet from entring <hi>Breſt</hi> Harbour. But the Count <hi>de Tourville</hi> took the opportunity of a favourable Wind to gain a certain Point betwixt the <hi>French</hi> ſhoar and the Rocks, where the Enemy could not come near enough to attack him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he tarry long there, for the Wind which had carried him thither happen'd to chop about to another corner, ſo that the Confederate Fleet durſt not venture to ſtay longer thereabouts; and whilſt the Enemies Fleet was in diſorder, in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Courſe, the ſame Wind which prov'd contrary to them, carried him ſafely into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:65930:95"/>The King was no ſooner advertis'd of the Count <hi>de Tourville</hi>'s ſafe arrival at <hi>Breſt,</hi> and conſequently ſaw himſelf deliver'd from the fear he was in for this Squadron, but he ſent his Orders to the Marſhal <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> to put to Sea, and the Marſhal <hi>de Segnelay</hi> went in Perſon on board the Fleet, to encourage every body to the better performance of their Duty. The Enemies retreated thereupon towards the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſt, where Captain <hi>Greenville</hi> told me one Day, as we were drinking pretty ſmartly together; that I need not trouble my ſelf much about my Eſtate, becauſe, if I could have but a little patience, I ſhould ſee the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) Maſter, not only of that Province, but perhaps of all <hi>France.</hi> That the Province of <hi>Poictou</hi> was upon the point of revolting, that there were above 30000 <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in that Province, ready to join with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when ever they ſhould think fit to make a deſcent thereabouts; and that it was not to be doubted, but the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the other Provinces would follow their Example, which would put the <hi>French</hi> King ſo to it, that he would be glad to come to a Compoſition.</p>
               <p>I made him believe this was very welcome News to me, to make him the more open-hearted, and that he might not hide the leaſt thing from me, he knew concerning this intended Deſcent, of which I was reſolv'd to ſend word into <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as I could poſſibly dive into the bottom of the Deſign, and meet with a ſafe opportunity to have my Letters convey'd to the King.</p>
               <p>In two or three Days after, I began to be much out of order, the Sea not agreeing with me very well; and it was not long after, that I fell into a Fever, which made me deſire my Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> who had order'd all my Equipage (as much as could be found of it) to be reſtor'd to me, to give me leave to go on ſhoar. The Admiral having granted my Requeſt, Captain <hi>Greenville</hi> deſir'd I might be ſent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> (of which Place his Father was Governour) though elſe we were much nearer to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65930:95"/>
                  <hi>Falmouth.</hi> He writ likewiſe a Letter to the Deputy Governour, whoſe Name was <hi>Fleming,</hi> wherein he deſir'd him, not to let me want any thing I had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for, and that he would be ready to re-imburſe him, what he ſhould lay out upon that account, if I did not do it my ſelf. But I had no occaſion for any of his Money, becauſe it happen'd ſo fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for me, that I met with a certain <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man there, who being a Refugee, had a Son, who was a Priſoner in <hi>France.</hi> He was as glad as I, to meet with this opportunity to tranſmit ſome Money to his Son, ſo that he gave me immediately Twenty Piſtols, which he deſir'd ſhould be made good to his Son in <hi>France,</hi> and he was ſo generous as to tell me, that if I had occaſion for any more, I ſhould have it, nay, all what he had in the World ſhould be at my Service, if I would be pleas'd to accept of it.</p>
               <p>They had at that ſame time put the Lieutenant of the <hi>Wanton</hi> Friggot, and all the Seamen taken in her aſhoar at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where we were all together ſent to Priſon; but I had ſcarce been there half an Hour, before the Deputy Governour, unto whom I had ſent Captain <hi>Greenville</hi>'s Letter, came to fetch me out. I deſir'd him to do the ſame Favour to this Lieutenant, which he being ready to grant, we were conducted into the Cittadel of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where we met with a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, call'd <hi>Bruſs,</hi> and a Lieutenant of the Chevalier <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> who were likewiſe Priſoners of War. The laſt of theſe two had been taken together with his Captain, in a Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of Twenty Four Guns; and <hi>John du Bart</hi> (who as well as his Brother have made themſelves Famous ſince, by the many Prizes they have taken from the Enemy) Commanded another at the ſame time of Thirty Six Guns; they were both taken by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War of Seventy Guns, and carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our Soldiers put upon them, to keep a watchful Eye
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65930:96"/>
upon all their Actions. This happen'd very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for them, for being thereby diſcharg'd from their Word, they now began to contrive how to ſave themſelves by Flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John du Bart,</hi> who was always very quick at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, got by ſome means or other into an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seaman there, with whom he prevail'd at laſt ſo far, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to furniſh them with a Sloop, and ſo much Proviſion, as ſhould be ſufficient to carry them to <hi>France,</hi> which ſhould be ready at an Hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Every thing being got in readineſs, and the Day appointed to put their Deſign in Execution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, they made the Four Centinels that were their Guards very Drunk, ſo that they could neither ſit nor ſtand; they made uſe of this opportunity to cut their Sheets in pieces, which ſerv'd them inſtead of Ropes, by which they let themſelves down thro the Chamber Windows, where they Lodg'd. <hi>John du Bart</hi> himſelf ſupply'd the place of a Pilot, and brought the Sloop ſafe into St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, from whence they went to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> to ſolicite the exchange of their Lieutenant and Ships Crew, who remain'd Priſoners at <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Name of the Lieutenant of the Chevalier <hi>Fourbin</hi> was <hi>de Vaux,</hi> a very honeſt Gentleman, being Son to a Gentleman, who was then in the Service of the Princeſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> the King's Daughter. The Lieutenant told me one Day, that his Captain had ſent him word, that it would not be long before they ſhould be exchang'd; which made me reſolve to ſound his Inclinations, whether he would oblige me in taking along with him a Letter of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence into <hi>France.</hi> He told me, that he was very ready to ſerve me in any thing, but that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, he might be narrowly ſearch'd at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and if any thing of this nature ſhould be found about him, it might turn to his great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When I found him unreſolv'd what beſt to do, I told him, that the Letter I was going to ſend, concern'd our King's Service. He then anſwer'd
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65930:96"/>
me with a great deal of eagerneſs, that provided it was ſo, there ſhould be no danger ſo great, unto which he would not willingly expoſe himſelf; but that he muſt ask my pardon, if he deſir'd firſt to be fully ſatisfied as to that point. Conſidering with my ſelf, that I had not the leaſt reaſon in the World to ſuſpect a Perſon, who had declar'd himſelf with ſo much Zeal for his Majeſty's Intereſt, I gave him a ſhort account of what had happen'd to me, whilſt I was in the Enemies Fleet, and what I had underſtood concerning their Deſigns, and what Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence they had with the Proteſtants in <hi>Poictou.</hi> I told him, that the Letter I intended to commit to his care, contain'd nothing but what related to this Subject, of which I intended to give Advice to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> but that I intended to write the Direction to the Marqueſs <hi>de Livri</hi> a Kinſman of mine, who was afterwards to deliver it to the Chief Miniſter. He anſwer'd me then, without the leaſt heſitation, that I ſhould get the Letter ready, and that he would diſcharge his truſt to the utmoſt of his power. In a few Days after, Orders being come from Court for his exchange, he embark'd at <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> with ſeveral others who were likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd at the ſame time, and got ſafely into <hi>France.</hi> But in lieu of delivering my Letter to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Livri,</hi> according to my direction, he gave it to his Father, who thereby got an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to preſent it to the King in Perſon.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who, ſometime before had been declar'd King by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, ſent for me to <hi>London.</hi> I had my Charges defray'd in my Journey, and as I came to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> I met with ſome <hi>French</hi> Officers there, who came to ſee me, and they were ſo generous as to offer me their Purſes, if I pleas'd to accept of it, though they had never ſeen me before. Their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and ſeveral Diſcourſes we had together, made me look upon them as very honeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and I found that they had ſtill a true <hi>French</hi> Heart, which made me reflect what a pity it was,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65930:97"/>
that their blind Zeal for their Religion, ſhould rob their Native Country, of the Service they might elſe have been able to do for their King in this War. But being not in any want of Money, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them thanks for their Civilities, and purſu'd my Journey to <hi>Salisbury.</hi> I thought I ſhould have been torn to pieces by the Rabble there, and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, I ſhould ſcarce have eſcap'd their Hands, if I had not been protected by him who was my Conductor: For no ſooner had it been nois'd about among the Mobb, that I was a <hi>French</hi> Officer, who was taken as I was going to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but they came in a tumultuous manner to the Inn where I was, and began to be very outragious; neither could they be appeas'd or perſwaded to diſperſe, before a Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was ſent for, who ſhew'd them his Staff, as a mark of his Authority.</p>
               <p>After I came to <hi>London,</hi> I was ſurrender'd to my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . 's Hands, who took my <hi>Parole of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and told me, that if I wanted any Money he had ſome at my Service; and that I might take my Lodgings where I lik'd beſt; that his Father would have offer'd me his Houſe, but for fear of giving ſuſpicion, I had better take a Private Lodging ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe. I then took up my Quarters at a <hi>French</hi> Ordinary in the <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> not far from St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . came the next Morning to fetch me out, and introduce me to the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . After I had been there a little while, he ask'd me, whether I would give my <hi>Parole of Honour</hi> to him, which I readily conſented to, and ſo he diſcharg'd my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . from his engagement for my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This firſt Interview being taken up with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments only, I return'd to my Lodgings, without having had the opportunity to enter upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſcourſe with him at that time.</p>
               <p>The next Day after, my Lord introduc'd me to the Marſhal of <hi>Shomburgh,</hi> who was then General of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces. He was a Native of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and had formerly been Captain of the Guards to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s (King <hi>William</hi> III.) Father,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65930:97"/>
from whence he went into the <hi>French</hi> Service, where he made himſelf very Famous by his Glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially in the laſt War betwixt the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> There being at that time a ſtrict Alliance betwixt <hi>France</hi> and that Kingdom, they ſolicited his Majeſty for ſome Succours againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after the concluſion of the <hi>Pyrencan</hi> Treaty. The occaſion of this War, was no leſs than a Conteſt about the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> pretended to belong to him. But by the Conduct of the Marſhal <hi>de Schombergh,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were at laſt forc'd to reſign their Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to that Crown.</p>
               <p>After ſo glorious a Period of this War on the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi> ſide, <hi>Schombergh</hi> return'd into <hi>France,</hi> where he Married <hi>Madamoiſelle de Aucourt</hi> of the Province of <hi>Picardy,</hi> for his ſecond Wife. The King gave them very conſiderable Preſents, notwithſtanding they were both Proteſtants. He likewiſe put him at the Head of his Armies, which was look'd upon as a peculiar Favour, conſidering, that beſides his being a Proteſtant, he was alſo a Foreigner. Thus he commanded the <hi>French</hi> Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in the Year 1673<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was made Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> after he had by his great Conduct ſav'd the King's Army, which was, by the ill management of Monſieur <hi>le Bret,</hi> upon the point of having fallen a Sacrifice to the Enemy, and retook alſo the Caſtle of <hi>Bellegarde.</hi> In the next following Year, the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> which was vigorouſly attack'd by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was perform'd under his Conduct; and he had at ſeveral times ſince, given ſuch unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable proofs of his Valour and Experience in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Affairs, that he was look'd upon as one of the greateſt Generals in <hi>Europe:</hi> But after the Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> by our King, he found himſelf under an indiſpenſible neceſſity, either to change his Religion, or elſe to leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:65930:98"/>Our King did all that in him lay to keep him in his Service, and the Marſhal, who had not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bought himſelf a very fine Eſtate near <hi>Paris,</hi> which coſt him 100000 Crowns, ſhew'd no great inclination to part with it ſo ſoon, which made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny believe, he would at laſt comply with the King's deſires; eſpecially when they conſider'd, that he being a Perſon of great Natural Parts, could not but be convinc'd by this time, of the Vanity of thoſe ridiculous Inſinuations (as many others of the <hi>Hereticks</hi> had been of late) invented by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to impoſe upon the Credulity of their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; to wit, <hi>That the Catholicks are Idolaters.</hi> Nay there were ſome at that time, who pretended that when he Commanded the King's Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he was upon the point of having chang'd his Religion, but that his Lady, who had a great aſcendant over him, had diſſwaded him from it.</p>
               <p>Thus it was ſuppos'd, that the Marſhal <hi>Schombergh</hi> would not have let things come to the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, if an unlucky Accident had not happen'd, in which, as he believ'd his Honour to be concern'd, ſo he choſe rather to loſe all, than to abate the leaſt of his Pretenſions in that point.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, that Monſieur <hi>du Queſne,</hi> who Commanded the King's Fleet, was a Proteſtant as well as he, and no leſs Zealous, which made him beg of our King, to permit him to end his Days in the ſame Religion he was Educated in, and had always profeſs'd. He being a Perſon, who was in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary eſteem with his Majeſty, and who, to confeſs the Truth, could not well be ſpar'd at that time, the King granted his Requeſt. The Marſhall <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> who thought he had deſerv'd as well of his Majeſty in the Land Service, as the other had at Sea, begg'd of His Majeſty, that he would be pleas'd to give him the ſame Marks of his Favour, as he had done to Monſieur <hi>du Queſne,</hi> which the King refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to do, he left <hi>France</hi> with his Sons, who were very brave Gentlemen. From thence he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> to offer his Service to his <hi>Britannick</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty:
<pb facs="tcp:65930:98"/>
But he being no leſs zealous for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion than our King, he return'd him thanks for his offer. After this, he went to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>'s Court, where he met with a much more favourable Reception. For the Elector did not only pay him all imaginable Reſpect, but alſo heap'd upon him Favours upon Favours.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal, who had all the reaſon in the World to be ſatisfi'd with the kind Reception he met with in the Court of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> which ſoon comforted him for the Denial he had met with in <hi>England</hi> (which, he was ſenſible, was chiefly upon the account of his Religion) did however not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in that Court.</p>
               <p>For the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who had then already laid the foundation of thoſe great Deſigns, which he put afterwards in Execution with ſuch incredible Succeſs, did invite him to his Court, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make uſe of his Service, in convenient time and place. After his arrival, the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtrove to outvie the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> himſelf, in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Reſpects to the Marſhal; For, it is to be obſerv'd, that the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> had always ſhew'd a more than ordinary eſteem for his Perſon, and many Years before, when the States ſtood in Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> (during the Princes Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) they had made particular Applications to his Majeſty, to give permiſſion to the ſaid Marſhal, to Command their Forces as General.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Schombergh</hi> was no ſooner arriv'd at the <hi>Hague,</hi> but he waited on the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who endeavour'd to engage him into his Service, by great promiſes of Reward, which indeed he has fulfill'd ſince, without the leaſt diminution; for he not only Created him Duke and Peer of <hi>England,</hi> immediately after he was Crown'd King of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo allow'd him a ſuitable Penſion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave him an Eſtate of ſome Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:65930:99"/>It is eaſie to be imagin'd, that the Marſhal, who was come with no other Intention than to ſerve the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> did without much difficulty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of theſe advantageous Offers made to him, and aſſur'd the Prince of the utmoſt of his Service and Fidelity, by which means he was admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very Secrets of that Enterprize, in which he bore ſo conſiderable a ſhare not long after.</p>
               <p>There were many, who look'd upon it (and not altogether without reaſon) as a blemiſh to his great Reputation, to bear Arms againſt his King, to whom he ſtood indebted for his whole Fortune; For it was upon his Majeſty's Recommendation, that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had made him <hi>Grandee</hi> of that Kingdom, and had beſtow'd upon him the Earldom of <hi>Mertolo;</hi> beſides the many Favours he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his Majeſty's own Hands. But on the other hand it ought to be conſider'd, that he was no Native of <hi>France,</hi> but a Foreigner, and it could not but ſtick very cloſe to his Stomach, to ſee the King refuſe him that, which he had granted to Monſieur <hi>du Queſne,</hi> who was his natural born Subject; and it was queſtionleſs, upon the ſcore of this Difference, that he thought himſelf under leſs Obligation than another. For the reſt, it is obſervable, that he did not lay down his Marſhals-Staff of <hi>France,</hi> neither reſign'd the Yearly Penſion, which our King was pleas'd to allot him, till after he had been an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs himſelf, with what a general Applauſe the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was receiv'd in <hi>England,</hi> which gave him ſufficient hopes of puſhing his Fortune there at leaſt to the ſame degree, with that he had left behind: Neither did he find himſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in his account; for, though he had left the Service of a Potent Prince, yet he had this comfort, that he was conſiderably advanc'd, both in Dignity and Eſtate.</p>
               <p>I went, the next day after I had been with the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . to wait on him in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where his Lodgings were, being the ſame that had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong'd to King <hi>James,</hi> when he was Duke of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65930:99"/>
                  <hi>York.</hi> I was again Introduc'd by my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . and he took me alone with him into his Cloſet, the better to diſcourſe with me concerning the <hi>French</hi> Affairs, and the preſent condition of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for, the Pr . . . having given him an account of my Engagement to my Lord <hi>T</hi> . . . . ., he look'd upon me no otherwiſe than one of his own Party, and who had devoted himſelf and all his Service to that Prince.</p>
               <p>The Subject we moſt inſiſted upon, was about the Province of <hi>Poictou;</hi> and he ask'd me in what Condition the Proteſtants were thereabouts at that time? Whether it were true what had been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, that they were more numerous in that Province than the Catholicks? and whether the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were alſo diſcontented, and whether conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there might be any probability they would join with the Proteſtants, in caſe of a Deſcent to be made by the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> I anſwer'd frankly as to this point, that he was miſinform'd, as to what concern'd the Catholicks, being ſure, there were at leaſt Twenty Catholicks to One Proteſtant in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and as to their being diſcontented, there was not much to be rely'd upon that bottom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew as well as my ſelf, that tho' the <hi>French</hi> would give a great deal of liberty to their Tongues, yet they were nevertheleſs, the moſt affectionate People in the World for their King's Service.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral other ſuch like Diſcourſe, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part to the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> he was pleas'd to tell me, that he was overjoy'd to underſtand I had taken a Reſolution to ſerve the Prince, and that he would do all that lay in his power, to ſhew upon all occaſions, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he valued both my Perſon and Service; that he was to go the next Day to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> to wait on the Pr . . ., and that he deſired me not to fail to be there, becauſe he intended to introduce me to him. I was there at the very Hour he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and after a little ſtay, the Pr . . . being told that I was there, he order'd the Duke of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65930:100"/>
me by a private pair of back Stairs into his Cloſet, without being taken notice of by any Body. To be ſhort, I was introduc'd to him, I Diſcourſed with him, and acted my part ſo to the Life, that he was perſwaded as well as the reſt had been before, that I had devoted my ſelf entirely to his Service. Our Diſcourſe did run much upon the ſame ſtrain, as that with the Duke of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Affairs in <hi>France,</hi> concerning which, after I had told him what I thought beſt for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he anſwered me, That he would make good my Lord <hi>T</hi> . . . . .'s Promiſe to me; and that he would take care I ſhould not be a loſer, by having engaged in his Service; for which purpoſe he would make me a Lieutenant-General, and that I ſhould ſerve under the Duke of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſhortly to ſend with an Army into <hi>Ireland:</hi> That he would order the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . to get forthwith my Commiſſion ready, and would order me ſome Money out of his Treaſury to defray my Charges, and equip my ſelf according to my Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I had been admitted to kiſs his Hand, as I was firſt introduced into his Preſence, and he gave it me to kiſs again, as I was going away, and all the while I diſcours'd with him, he careſs'd me in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if I had been the only Man that could do him the moſt Service. I ſtay'd two Days longer at <hi>H</hi> . . . becauſe the Pr . . . happened at the ſame time to take a review of thoſe Troops that were to be ſent into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Among the reſt there were two <hi>French</hi> Regiments there, one of Horſe, the other of Foot, which had been raiſed by the Duke of <hi>S</hi> . . . . and were both called by his Name. There were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſeveral other <hi>French</hi> Regiments there, deſign'd for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Service, who were much valued by the Duke, and I believe they might amount in all to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four Thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>If one may give credit to what was reported at that time, there were not a few of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were of Opinion, That it would be beſt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern themſelves any further with <hi>Ireland,</hi> believing,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65930:100"/>
that they would find it a hard Task to recover it from the late King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> But the Pr . . having convinced them by undeniable Reaſons, that <hi>England</hi> muſt never expect to be at quiet, till they had drawn that Thorn out of their Foot, it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſend a Fleet to their Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution was imparted to the Inhabitants of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> who were reduced to great Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; for being block'd up on all ſides, before they could have the opportunity of providing the place with ſufficient Proviſions, they had by this time conſumed the greateſt part of what they had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring into the place in haſte; and they were come to ſo ſlender an Allowance, that what was left, was divided among them every Day by Weight and Meaſure.</p>
               <p>The whole Management of this Relief of <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry,</hi> was committed to the Management of Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> who had ſome Forces, and ſeventeen Ships of all ſorts allotted him for this Enterprize. King <hi>James</hi> having received Intelligence that his Fleet was ready to ſet Sail for the River of <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derry,</hi> he ordered General <hi>Roſe</hi> to reinforce the Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of the place with five Thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>He was to paſs in his way thither by the Fort of <hi>Frome,</hi> where there was a Garriſon of King <hi>James</hi>'s, this being a Paſs betwixt <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Londonderry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Iniskilling</hi> being encouraged by the late News of Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi>'s Approach, reſolved to Attack this Fort, not only to prevent the March of General <hi>Roſe,</hi> but likewiſe to intercept the Convoys which muſt go that way to <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Camp.</p>
               <p>The Eldeſt Son of my Lord <hi>Blare,</hi> who was then ſcarce Twenty Years of Age, commanded in the Fort; the Garriſon of which conſiſted only of two Companies of Dragoons, notwithſtanding which, he defended himſelf two Days againſt four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, who Attack'd him vigorouſly, but in vain; For General <hi>Roſe</hi> having thereby time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to advance to the Relief of the place,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65930:101"/>
the Enemies, upon notice of it, retired from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>From thence General <hi>Roſe</hi> marched to <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Quarters, and after he had taken a view of the whole Place, and all the Avenues leading to it, it was agreed, that the beſt thing they could do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for their Royal Maſter's Service, was to take care, that no Relief might be thrown into the Place. He told <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that his Opinion was, Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Kirk</hi> would try his utmoſt to relieve it by the way of the River.</p>
               <p>They had made themſelves Maſters of the Fort of <hi>Culmore</hi> the Year before, which lying at the Entrance of the River of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> it commands one ſide, and they erected a Battery on the oppoſite Shoar to hinder the approach of the Enemies Fleet. All along on both ſides of the River ſeveral Entrenchments were made, for the conveniency of the Infantry, who were to ply them as they paſs'd by, with ſmall Shot. But looking upon all this as not ſufficient to ſtop the Enemies Paſſage, it was reſolved to make a ſtrong <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>accado,</hi> or Boom, croſs the River, to ſtop the Ships which otherwiſe might perhaps by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a ſtrong ſide, endeavour to get into the Town; But the Engineers who were employed in perfecting it were ſo little skill'd in what they had undertaken, that the Piles which were ramm'd into the bottom of the River, were carried away twice, by the violence of the Tide and Current, the third time it was attempted with ſomewhat better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but could only be ſecured at both ends with Wooden Piles; the want of which was ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the middle part of it by ſtrong Ropes, which Defect ſtood the Enemy in great ſtead, as they advanc'd with their Ships to the Relief of the Place.</p>
               <p>In the mean while thoſe within were driven to the utmoſt Extremity, notwithſtanding which, his late <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's Council, who look'd upon it as much more Glorious to take it by force, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it by Famine, ſent Orders to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to open
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65930:101"/>
the Trenches before it. He obey'd theſe Orders, but the Attack was carried on againſt that part of the Town where it was of moſt difficult Acceſs. This was occaſioned by the Obſtinacy of the Chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer, who being no great Conjurer in his Art, yet would not hearken to the Advice of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The Beſieged made frequent Sallies with ſo much Bravery and Conduct, that no more could have been expected from a well Diſciplin'd Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>In one of theſe Sallies they kill'd Monſieur <hi>Puſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> a <hi>French Marſhal du Camp,</hi> an experienced and brave Officer; And the ſame Fate attended Monſieur <hi>de Monmont</hi> in another Sally. He was a Perſon who had an equal ſhare of Courage and Conduct, and who had formerly been Captain of the Guards to our King, and ſerved in the Quality of a Lieutenant-General under King <hi>James.</hi> He might have been ſaved, if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops, who were appointed to ſerve him, had done their Duty; but inſtead of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his Relief, at the Signal given (as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed betwixt them) they did not ſtir from their Poſt.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Roſe</hi> had met with a great deal of Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince his coming into this Country, but the loſs of theſe two brave Officers, was a great addition to his former Diſappointments. He therefore gave an Account to the late King of <hi>England,</hi> how Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters went in the Camp, deſiring him to take his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice into due Conſideration, by which means he might be made ſenſible that he was not ſerved as he ought to be. And to give General <hi>Roſe</hi> his due, he ſpoke nothing more than was true in effect; for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were generally very negligent in their Duty, which furniſh'd the Enemy with many a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to fall upon them with great ſucceſs; and thoſe who had the ſupream Adminiſtration of Affairs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>James,</hi> acted ſo diſorderly in every thing, that one would have imagined no otherwiſe, but that they did it on purpoſe, to make us miſcarry in the Siege. Sometimes they had Powder, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65930:102"/>
none, and if they had Powder, perhaps they wanted Matches; if they had Matches, they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Powder; and thus it was with all other things in proportion.</p>
               <p>To make up the Matter, <hi>Hamilton</hi> Attack'd a Mill, which the Beſieged had Fortify'd at ſome diſtance from the Town, on which he made uſe of more Horſe than Foot, tho' it be evident, that the laſt were much more uſeful for that Enterprize, than the firſt; which was the reaſon he was forced to retire with the loſs of a great many of his Men.</p>
               <p>Whilſt things ſtood thus in the Camp, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Londonderry</hi> died, partly of the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fatigue he underwent daily, partly as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for Vexation, to ſee the Inhabitants reduced to the higheſt degree of Miſery.</p>
               <p>A certain Miniſter of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, who had ſignaliz'd himſelf<note place="margin">Walker.</note> during the Siege, being put in his place, did acquit himſelf with a great deal of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this Station. He made frequent Sallies upon the Beſiegers, and among the reſt gall'd them extreamly from an Entrenchment which his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor had cauſed to be made upon that ſide where it looks towards the Sea.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who work'd in the Trenches, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves continually annoy'd by the Fire of the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Hamilton</hi> order'd it to be Attack'd. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it was committed to the Conduct of the Marqueſs <hi>de Angleurs,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Officer, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been likewiſe a Captain of the King's Guards, and ſerved in this Expedition in the Quality of a <hi>Marſhal du Camp.</hi> He marched in Perſon at the Head of ſeveral brave <hi>French</hi> Officers, ſuſtained by ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Troops, and was dangerouſly wounded; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, he would not quit his Poſt, but continued to give the neceſſary Orders, till they were Maſters of the Entrenchment.</p>
               <p>But this ſtood the Beſiegers in no great ſtead, the Beſieged being of an Invincible Courage: By this time Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> was come to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65930:102"/>
the Entrance of the River, and being ſenſible, that theſe brave Fellows, who were not to be Conquered, by the Sword, Dagger, or Fatigues, muſt at laſt buckle to Famine, if they were not ſpeedily reliev'd, he contrived a Stratagem to draw General <hi>Roſe</hi> from thence another way. He order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three Thouſand Men to Land at about Ten Miles diſtance from the Mouth of the River, who having ſtrongly Entrench'd themſelves in a ſmall Iſland, were to be joined by 5000 <hi>Iniskilling</hi> Men, with a deſign to fall upon General <hi>Roſe,</hi> whilſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Kirk,</hi> ſhould endeavour to open his Paſſage by the way of the River, and to force the Boom. General <hi>Roſe</hi> who gave a ſhrewd gueſs at their deſign, thought it moſt adviſable, to endeavour to engage theſe three Thouſand Men, before they could be joyned by thoſe of <hi>Iniskilling.</hi> The Siege was left to the Management of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> with Orders to take all imaginable precaution againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies relieving the place, by the way of the River. The Fort of <hi>Culmore</hi> was provided with a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and ſo were all the other Poſts I mentioned before. But a favourable Gale ariſing, Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Kirk</hi> took this opportunity to enter the River with two of his beſt Ships, having alſo the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a high Afternoons Tide, and as if Fate had conſpired againſt us, to render his Enterprize ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, theſe two Ships paſſed without the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on their ſide, betwixt the Fire of the Fort of <hi>Culmore,</hi> and that of the great Battery upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Shoar; and after that out-braved the Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the Infantry, which was poſted behind the Intrenchments on both ſides of the River, without receiving any more damage, than if they had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unmoleſted, and had not been fired at by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers.</p>
               <p>Thus they came ſafely to the Boom, where one of the Ships broke the Cables that were joined on both ſides of the Wooden Piles; which being done, there was nothing left to obſtruct their Paſſage to <hi>Londonderry,</hi> which they reach'd ſoon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:65930:103"/>It was the moſt ſurprizing thing in the World to ſee this Place relieved in ſuch a manner, and that by Day-light, without the loſs of one ſingle Man on the Enemies ſide. There were ſome who would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſay, that there was ſomething in it that was paſt finding out; or, elſe that it muſt be look'd upon as a peculiar piece of God's Judgments, which are hidden from us Mortals by his All-wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but however it was, this happy Succeſs haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s (King <hi>William</hi> III.) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to Tranſport an Army unto <hi>Ireland</hi> under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Schomberg.</hi> Tho' it muſt alſo be confeſs'd, That the Miniſter, who had been Governour of <hi>Londonderry,</hi> and who after the Place was relieved, was come to <hi>London,</hi> and had given the Prince (King <hi>William</hi> III.) an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the true State of Affairs in that Kingdom, did by his Encouragement, prove a great Inſtrument in forwarding the intended March of the ſaid Troops. He was very well rewarded for what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he had done during the Siege, not only by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral marks of a moſt particular eſteem, which the Prince (King <hi>William</hi> III.) was pleaſed to honour him with at that time, but he received likewiſe a Reward of ſeveral Thouſand Pounds Sterling.</p>
               <p>But this Digreſſion had almoſt made me forgetful of my own Condition, for I found my ſelf thus far entangled in the Buſineſs I had undertaken, that I was ſtrangely puzzled to find out a way to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me from it.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was pondring upon this Point, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Courſe beſt to take, God Almighty's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence furniſh'd me unexpectedly with an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which ſet my Heart at eaſe.</p>
               <p>One day as I went with the Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . to wait on the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . . I met there acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally with two <hi>French</hi> Men, who formerly had been <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and had juſt then delivered a <hi>Memorandum</hi> to the ſaid Earl, containing ſome Propoſals much to the ſame purpoſe as had been told me before by Captain <hi>Granville,</hi> and the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65930:103"/>
D. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . with this difference only, that they were more ſpecial in the Matter, and had inſerted the Names of many Gentlemen in <hi>Poictou,</hi> who, as they pretended, had engaged among themſelves in that Province to take up Arms, if they could meet with a favourable juncture.</p>
               <p>The E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . imagining that I could not but know all the Nobility of that Country, deſired me to come into his Cloſet, where he told theſe two Miniſters, That they might Talk before me with all imaginable freedom, there being not the leaſt reaſon for them to ſuſpect me, becauſe he knew me to be a Perſon, who might do them conſiderable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Matter in hand.</p>
               <p>After they had received this Aſſurance from the Earls own Mouth, they began to explain the whole Matter at length, without diſguiſing any thing of what was contained in their <hi>Memorandum.</hi> Nay, they did not ſtick to Name to me five or ſix of the Nobility of the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> whom I was ſure, I knew much better than they poſſibly could do. They took a great deal of pains to perſwade us that theſe alone would bring five or ſix Thouſand Men into the Field at the firſt Beat of Drum, and that the reſt of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> thereabouts would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Example; (becauſe theſe two Sparks ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to be as Zealous as themſelves.) They added, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were only waiting for a favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to free themſelves from thoſe Tyrannies, which, they ſaid, were daily exerciſed upon them; and that the leaſt Revolt in one Province, would be the Signal to all the reſt to ſhake off that Yoak, which like a heavy Burthen quite oppreſs'd them. They told us, there needed no more than to furniſh them with Arms and Ammunition, which done they would ſoon give ſufficient Encouragement to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to put them under a Head, fit to Command a good Army; there being not the leaſt queſtion, but that they would be daily joined by a conſiderable number of brave Officers and Soldiers; nay, even
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65930:104"/>
by many of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> themſelves, who were quite exhauſted by the heavy Taxes laid upon them, and conſequently grown quite weary of the preſent <hi>French</hi> Government.</p>
               <p>I let them run on in their Diſcourſe, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting them in the leaſt, but rather ſeem'd to ſide with them. Tho' at the ſame time I knew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more falſe, than what they would make us believe concerning the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> nay even in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of moſt of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves, who had any thing to loſe, whom I knew not to be ſo well diſpoſed, as they pretended, to hazard their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>I am well convinced, that there were a great Number among them, who wiſh'd with all their Hearts to ſee their Religion re-eſtabliſh'd in <hi>France;</hi> but if they ſhould be ſuppoſed to be ſo very Zealous as theſe Miniſters would have made 'em, they might as many others have done, have left <hi>France,</hi> and not have prefer'd their Eſtates before their Religion; whereas thoſe who went away, left every thing they had for their Religions ſake. I look'd upon it as a thing which ſufficiently explain'd it ſelf, and which appear'd ſo viſible to me, that I wonder'd how any unbyaſs'd Perſon could not diſcern it, that thoſe who had ſhew'd themſelves ſuch great Admirers of Riches, would ſcarce endanger their Eſtates upon the ſame ſcore, unleſs it were upon ſome remarkable Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their Arguments, and ſeveral other Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes we had together at that time, made me make this Obſervation to my ſelf, <hi>That Miniſters of the Church, make but very indifferent Miniſters of State;</hi> but my Buſineſs being at this time to dive to the bottom of their Deſign, I was ſo far from contradicting them, that I told neither them nor the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . one Word of what I thought.</p>
               <p>After theſe two <hi>French</hi> Miniſters were gone, I ſtay'd for ſome time longer with the E. who reaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the former Diſcourſe, and at laſt came to what concerned me in particular. He delivered to me my Commiſſion of Lieutenant General, purſuant

to the Orders he had received from the Pr. and told me, That he would take effectual care to get a Warrant for the receiving of the Money.</p>
               <p>After I return'd to my Lodging, I began afreſh to ruminate upon my preſent Circumſtances; and conſidering my preſent Condition, I did not ſee how I could avoid to confide my ſelf to ſome Body or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; tho' according to the Rules of Prudence, I was ſenſible I ought to truſt no Body with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret but my ſelf.</p>
               <p>There happened juſt at that time to Lodge a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>French</hi> Man at the ſame Ordinary where I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had been a conſiderable time in <hi>London:</hi> His Brother who had lived there before him, had ſent for him out of <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt him in managing his Buſineſs, which for the moſt part was the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> Trade. But his Brother happening to die juſt at the beginning of this laſt Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> he ſtay'd behind, till ſuch time he could draw off all his Effects: He was then juſt making every thing ready for his Journey into <hi>France,</hi> for which purpoſe he had obtained a Paſs from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) I had always look'd upon him as a very Honeſt Gentleman, and had found him very affectionate for our King's Service, and a true <hi>Catholick;</hi> all which induced me to ask him the ſame Queſtion I had ask'd before of the Chevalier <hi>de Fourbin</hi>'s Lieutenant; to wit, Whether he would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige me ſo far as to carry a Letter from me to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> I told him that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to have heard him ſay ſeveral times, that he had Buſineſs of great conſequence with that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, which if it were ſo, I durſt engage this would be a means for him to have a very favourable Audience. He told me, that he would do it with all his Heart, and to the utmoſt of his power; ſo that I reſolved to give Intelligence to this Miniſter, of all what had paſs'd, and how I was likely to be ſent ſhortly into <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the Marſhal <hi>de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> deſiring to receive his Commands, whether after I came into <hi>Ireland</hi> I ſhould take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

to go over to his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty's Camp. But juſt the ſame Night as I was going to write this Letter, a Thought came into my Head, which made me delay Writing for that time, till I might have the opportunity to try whether my Project would ſucceed or not.</p>
               <p>I told you before that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court were buoyed up with ſtrong hopes by ſome of the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> that their Brethren in the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> had form'd a ſtrong Party there, to favour a Deſcent from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I judged therefore I might make good uſe of this to my advantage, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I could inſinuate to them, That conſidering my preſent Circumſtances I ſhould be able to do them much greater Service in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try if they would be pleaſed to diſpatch me thither, than if I were employed in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Service.</p>
               <p>If I ſucceeded in this Project, I was ſure to be ſent back into <hi>France,</hi> without the leaſt danger on my ſide, where I did not queſtion to meet with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable incouragement as a Recompence for the Service I had done our King, in making my ſelf Maſter of a Secret, which they ſcarce would have been able to diſcover in time without my aſſiſtance. After I had ruminated upon the Matter all that Night and part of the next Morning, the firſt thing I did, was to try how this Propoſition would reliſh with the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . and my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . with whom I uſed to Dine almoſt every Day.</p>
               <p>I gave them a ſhort Account of what I had heard the two <hi>French</hi> Miniſters propoſe to the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . and took this opportunity to enlarge further upon that Subject, and what Service I believed I was able to do in the Province of <hi>Poictou.</hi> They anſwered immediately, that I need not queſtion in the leaſt but that I ſhould meet with ſufficient Encouragement from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court in this deſign, that they would adviſe me to ſpeak about it to the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . and they would go along with me to him to back this Project, which they look'd upon as of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the State, and the moſt prejudicial that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65930:106"/>
could be thought of to the Enemy. I told them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that if they had a mind the thing ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer expectation, they muſt be very careful not to let it take vent; and therefore deſired them not to Communicate this Secret to any body Living, not even to the D . . . of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . . himſelf; becauſe ſaid I, he has a particular fancy for me to go along with him to <hi>Ireland.</hi> And as to the laſt, I ſpoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no more than the Truth. For whether it was that he wanted good Horſe Officers, or whether he really had conceived a better opinion of my ability than of ſome others; he would frequently tell me, that he rely'd much upon the good ſervice I was likely to do him, in diſciplining ſeveral Regiments of new rais'd Troops, which were to go over with him ſhortly into <hi>Ireland.</hi> I had no other reaſon in the World, but to believe what he ſaid was ſpoken with a Sincere intention to oblige me; whereas I am certain it vexed me as often as I heard him ſay ſo; I having not the leaſt inclination at that time, to ſerve againſt the King my Maſter; what I had done formerly, was owing to an abſolute neceſſity, and the ill Circumſtances of my Affairs in <hi>France;</hi> which had forced me from thence, to ſeek for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in another place.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>P.</hi> . . . . and my Lord <hi>L.</hi> . . . . . ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed ſecreſie, I went the next day to wait on the Earl of <hi>S.</hi> . . . . ; and as I had ſpent the greateſt part of that night in ruminating all the Circumſtances of the matter, I was to propoſe to him, I told him, that the longer I conſidered of what theſe Miniſters had offered the other day, the more feaſible it appear'd to me; and that this had induced me to take a Reſolution to do all the Service I was capable of to encourage the Deſign: That I had many Friends and Relations in that Province, and that I was of Opinion, if the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Court thought fit to make uſe of my Service thereabouts, I could influence the <hi>Arrier-Ban,</hi> who were extreamly harraſſed and diſſatisfied with being forced to Guard the Sea-Coaſts every Summer;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65930:107"/>
and that I did not queſtion, by my Perſuaſions, to bring them over, to join with us in caſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent; conſidering eſpecially, that many among them were Proteſtants, who would lend me a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand to perſuade the reſt. I aſſured him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there was ſcarce any thing which would be able to work more effectually upon their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, than when they underſtood that they were to be headed by one of their own Country, who's Friends and Relations were known to them; that by this means the intended Deſcent might be made eaſie, and conſequently a happy iſſue be expected from this Diverſion.</p>
               <p>The E. of <hi>S.</hi> . . . . finding what I ſaid to carry with it a great deal of probability, gave me for anſwer, that I had done very well to ſpeak to him about it; that he would tell it the King, and that if he approved of it, I ſhould be ſent no where elſe.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he propoſed the matter that very day to the Prince, who liking my Propoſals as well as the reſt had done, ordered the E. to bring me to him the next day, in the ſame place he had talk'd with me before.</p>
               <p>I went the next morning, about Nine a Clock, with the E. of <hi>S.</hi> . . . . to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where I repreſented the Buſineſs with ſo much appearance of great Advantages to the Prince, that he ordered the E. of <hi>S.</hi> . . . . immediately to give me another Commiſſion in <hi>French</hi> in lieu of the former, which was in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that when I ſhould come into <hi>Poictou,</hi> thoſe who were ready there to join with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might be convinced by their own Eyes, that I had been appointed to Command them; which would make them put the more confidence in what I ſhould propoſe, and the more willing to follow my Orders.</p>
               <p>I took this opportunity to ask a favour of the Prince, which was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he would be pleaſed to diſcharge my two Kinſmen, <hi>Vignol</hi> and <hi>Foreſt,</hi> who were made Priſoners at the ſame time, when I was
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65930:107"/>
taken, from their Impriſonment, which he had the goodneſs to grant me without delay.</p>
               <p>Being now aſſured of my ſudden return into <hi>France,</hi> I writ a Letter to the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> which I committed to the Care of the <hi>French</hi> Merchant I mentioned before: but this Letter contained a quite different Account from what I had writ before, and what I intended to have confirmed in the next, the Scene being much altered ſince that time.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for me to expreſs, with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience I waited every day, in hopes to receive my Diſpatches in order to my return into <hi>France;</hi> for to ſpeak the truth, I began to be much tired here, where every thing ſeemed to conſpire to make my ſtay burthenſome to my ſelf. Among others, I found this inconveniency, that there was ſcarce a place to hear Maſs in, unleſs it were at the Queen Dowagers Palace; and the common People were ſo much exaſperated againſt the Catholicks, that one could not go thither without being pointed at, and ſometimes they would not let you paſs by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beſtowing ſome Nick-name or other upon you. 'Tis true, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador had alſo Maſs ſaid at his Houſe; but beſides, that the <hi>French</hi> were not very kindly look'd upon there, the Room was ſcarce big enough to hold 20 People at once: Not that this Ambaſſador had leſs Pride in him than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> commonly have, but it had been his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſucceed in his Embaſſy to one who had run ſo much in Debt, that he was Arreſted; ſo that there were few who would venture to Lett his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor a Houſe, which was the reaſon he had been fain to take ſuch a one as he could meet with firſt.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, all the Ambaſſadors then in <hi>England,</hi> being extreamly diſſatisfied to ſee the Law of Nations violated in the Perſon of their Brother, the before-mentioned Ambaſſador, unanimouſly complained of it to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he who was in Cuſtody, made a heavy noiſe about the matter, and that not altogether without Reaſon; for beſides this Affront put upon his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65930:108"/>
he had another matter of Complaint, which ſerved for the moſt ſpecious pretence that could be.</p>
               <p>It is therefore to be obſerved, That after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, as he was marching up towards <hi>London,</hi> the King his Father-in-Law thought fit to leave the City in order to follow his Queen, who was gone before into <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>London</hi> Rabble laying hold of this Confuſion, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged the ſaid <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Houſe, who (whether truly or falſly it matters not) pretended that he had loſt more by this ſiniſter Accident, than would have over-pay'd his Debts. The Prince (King <hi>William</hi> III.) not knowing what better Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to pitch upon, to give Satisfaction to the Ambaſſadors, than to pay the Money, diſcharged his Debts, and ſo appeaſed the matter. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, moſt of the Foreign Nations look'd upon this Attempt as ſo hainous, that they ſpoke of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> in very diſreſpectful Terms. And not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the Truth, It is not only to Foreign Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors they have ſometimes been wanting in that reſpect, which is acknowledged to be due to their Character by all civiliz'd Nations, but there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not wanting Examples, when they have done the ſame to their own King; for, not long after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. a certain Brewer was ſo inſolent, as to Attach his Coach for ſome Money due to him.</p>
               <p>This may ſerve as one inſtance of what I told you juſt now, but what I am going to tell you will put it beyond all Exception.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Barillon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador to <hi>Charles</hi> II. King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> talking one day with a certain Lord in the King's Preſence, Sir F. <hi>C. . . . . s,</hi> (who was made a Lord afterwards) joined with them in their Diſcourſe, but had not ſpoke above three or four words in <hi>French,</hi> when he began to continue his Diſcourſe in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Barillon</hi> did not underſtand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which made him ask him what he ſaid; who pretending he could not
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65930:108"/>
talk in <hi>French,</hi> went on in his Native Tongue; Monſieur <hi>de Barillon</hi> ask'd him a ſecond time, what he ſaid; upon which, the other without any further Compliment, gave him the moſt ſenſible Anſwer of all, which was a good Box on the Ear. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador went the ſame moment to make his Complaint to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. who ſate not far off upon a Chair of State; who ordered <hi>C . . . . . . .s</hi> to be ſeized immediately, and to be carried to the <hi>Tower,</hi> which is the Priſon-Royal of <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> who abominated this Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, being reſolved to make him an Example of his Juſtice, granted a Commiſſion for his Trial; And as the Fact was of ſo odious a Nature, and of the greateſt Conſequence, he charged them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him to the utmoſt Severity the Law would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of. Monſieur <hi>de Barillon</hi> was not ſo Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to deſire his Death, but on the contrary, made his Applications to the King, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to Pardon <hi>C . . . . . s.</hi> But this Prince perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted immoveable in his Reſolution, to have him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed. Nevertheleſs, the Ambaſſador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his Prayers to the King, to obtain his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; who anſwered him very honourably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if he did ſhew himſelf ſo Generous as to forgive an Injury done him by a Perſon who had affronted him in the higheſt Degree, he ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd from ſhewing his Juſtice in puniſhing a Fact which could not be pardoned without drawing after it very pernicious Conſequences. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador finding all his hopes loſt of obtaining a Pardon from the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to our King, of whom he begg'd to intercede with King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to Pardon <hi>C . . . . s.</hi> Our Monarch, who would not be out-done in point of Generoſity by his Ambaſſador, writ in his behalf to the King of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> who unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any thing to ſo great an Interceſſor, pardoned <hi>C . . . . . s</hi> under this Condition however, That he ſhould ask the Ambaſſador's Pardon upon his Knees,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65930:109"/>
and afterwards go in Perſon into <hi>France,</hi> to give his humble Thanks to our King, for having, by his powerful Interceſſion, obtained his Pardon.</p>
               <p>Before I reaſſume the Thread of our Hiſtory, I cannot forbear to give you another inſtance of the ſame Nature, which happened much about the ſame time when I was in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of that City, to ſhew their reſpect for the Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) had both their Pictures ſet up in the Great-Hall call'd the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> among ſeveral other Pictures of the Kings and Queens of <hi>England:</hi> But whether ſome miſchievous Perſon, who envied them that place, and had hid himſelf in the Hall, was reſolved to put an Affront upon them; or whether it was done by Connivance of the Porter, who opens and ſhuts the Doors, both theſe Pictures were found the next day Cut and Defaced. All thoſe who were well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhers to the preſent Government in <hi>England,</hi> ſhew'd a great Concern at this Inſolence, and a good Sum of Money was offered as a Reward to ſuch as could diſcover the Author of it, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect, the Perſon who did it being not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to this day.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was Priſoner at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> had offered to have me Exchanged for one <hi>Latone,</hi> who having been a Commander in one of the <hi>Weſt India</hi> Iſlands, belonging to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was taken by one of our Privateers in his return home.</p>
               <p>But, after the King had ſhew'd him my Letter, which I had ſent by the Lieutenant of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> and whoſe Father had delivered it to the King, he did not ſo much preſs my Exchange as he had done before; being ſenſible that my ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> and the part I acted there, would be an infallible means to dive into the bottom of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's deſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65930:109"/>Not long after I had ſeen the Pr . . . . the ſecond time, an unknown Perſon came to ſee me at my Lodgings, and taking his opportunity to ſpeak to me without being over heard by any body; he told me, That the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> had ſent over from <hi>France,</hi> a Meſſenger, to impart to me ſome buſineſs of great Conſequence; and to let me know that he had received my Letter, which was addreſs'd to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> that his Orders were to continue to Act the Hypocrite with the Enemy, in the ſame manner as I had done hitherto; and that I ſhould take all the opportunities to let him know how ſquares went in <hi>England</hi> as often as I could do it without danger.</p>
               <p>All theſe Circumſtances, which I was ſure this ſtranger could not have but from very good Hands, were convincing reaſons to me, not to ſuſpect his Fidelity. I therefore made uſe of the ſame Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that was Iately come from <hi>France,</hi> unto whom I delivered an anſwer in Writing to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> in which I gave him much the ſame Accounts I had done before, in my Letter, which I ſent by the before mentioned <hi>French</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</p>
               <p>It was much about the ſame time, that a certain perſon of the firſt Rank in <hi>England</hi> (as I was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinced afterwards) came to me Incognito, and told me, that underſtanding I was ſhortly to return into <hi>France,</hi> and knowing me to be a <hi>French</hi> Officer of Note, he believed he might truſt me with a Secret, which was of the utmoſt conſequence. He further told me; That tho' moſt of the perſons of Quality of that Kingdom, had abandon'd his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, and had ſided with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) all the Temptations in the World ſhould never be prevailing enough with him to follow their example; he being reſolved to be Loyal to his King as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>He ſaid he was very Ambitious to Write a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King my Maſter, by whom he had the Honour to be known; and that he was come to pay
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65930:110"/>
me this viſit on purpoſe to ask me whether I would be willing to undertake the Delivery of the ſaid Letter.</p>
               <p>I did not imagine any otherwiſe than that this was ſome Spy or other, ſent either by the Pr . . . . or by the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . . to try whether I was the ſame perſon they believed me to be; which made me in lieu of anſwering him according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, entertain him with a great deal of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency; nay, ſo coldly, that I believe he was vexed to the Soul, he had diſcovered himſelf ſo Far.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing himſelf engag'd, paſt retreating, he thought it his beſt way to make an abſolute diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the whole matter to me; he then told me, that his Life was in my hands; becauſe he being known to be a declared Enemy of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) it would certainly coſt him his Head if it ſhould be known that he kept any Correſpondence with <hi>France:</hi> That he would tell me his Name, and what his Deſign was, for the advantage of his Prince, in hopes that his Quality and Loyalty, together with the Generous confidence he had put in me, would be a ſufficient inducement for me to uſe him as a Gentleman, ought to do: He then told me his Name, and if I could mention it here without prejudice, it would be apparent that I ſpoke nothing but the Truth, when I ſaid he was one of the moſt conſiderable Perſons in the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>His Name, and the Reputation he had ſo deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly gained by his Loyalty to his Royal Maſter, inſpired me with ſo much reſpect for his Perſon, that I began to ſpeak with more freedom than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet ſo, as to be very cautious, not to engage my ſelf in any thing that might be prejudicial to my preſent deſign, till I ſhould be fully convinced that he was the ſame Perſon he pretended to be. To be convinced of it, I deſired him to call upon me again the next day, at a certain appointed hour, where I took care to hide, in my Chamber, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65930:110"/>
                  <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, whom I knew I could truſt, and that he had often ſeen and ſpoke with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe Name I deſired to be ſatisfied in. My reſolution was, that if I had found I had been trapp'd, to carry my ſelf his Letter to the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . to clear my ſelf of all ſuſpicion; but he having told me nothing but what I found very true, I had no further occaſion to make uſe of this, or any other precaution.</p>
               <p>I ſaw him ſeveral times more before I left <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he having received Intelligence that the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> begun to be very urgent to have me Exchanged (being impatient to have an account of the State of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> from my own mouth,) he came to ſee me one Evening, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to a certain place where Colonel <hi>Grimes</hi> lay Abſconded. After he had enlarged much upon the Colonels Loyalty, he at laſt deſired me to let him go over with me into <hi>France,</hi> under the protection of my paſs; which was for me, and four of my Attendance; which I might eaſily do, I having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly three Servants, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Valet du Chamber,</hi> and two Footmen.</p>
               <p>The Colonel, when he thought he might ſafely appear before me, came out and deſired the ſame thing of me, which I promiſed them to do. But the Colonel meeting with an intimate Friend of his, who had likewiſe obtained a Paſs for one ſingle Perſon, and having not the opportunity to make preſent uſe of it for himſelf, had deſired him to give it to him, imagining that by this means he might go over with more ſecurity than if he went in my Company. His reaſon was, that I being a Stranger, both I and my Servants would in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood be more narrowly examined; whereas he being a Native, his Paſs would carry him off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Difficulty: But it happened quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Expectation; tho' he had diſguis'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 'tis true, when he came to <hi>Dover,</hi> he was ſo fool hardy, as to appear in the publick-ſtreets, ſo that he was diſcovered and put in priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:65930:111"/>The Colonel having as I told you, changed his Reſolution, I did almoſt believe that the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned perſon of Quality, had likewiſe alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Mind; for tho', as often as I ſaw him, he always told me, he would be ſure to bring me the Letters, nevertheleſs he did not come with them; ſo that if I had not known the Officer, who had told me who he was, to be a Man of Honour; I might eaſily have ſuſpected his Integrity; but as I knew this Officer to be a very honeſt Gentleman, who would ſcorn to tell me an untruth, I thought I had all the reaſon in the World to rely upon his Word; without any further precaution, of which you may be convinced by the follow Relation.</p>
               <p>He had formerly been a Captain of Foot in the <hi>French</hi> Service; but had been forc'd to fly that Kingdom by reaſon of a Duel he had fought with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Officer, and to look for Refuge in <hi>England,</hi> where he had obtained a Commiſſion under his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty.</p>
               <p>But this King being, after the Arrival of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> forc'd to leave the Kingdom; and the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> having after this misfortune Disbanded all his Forces, he was at preſent out of Employment, and reduced to that Extremity, that he ſcarce knew how to ſubſiſt any longer. There were ſeveral other <hi>French</hi> Officers at the ſame time in <hi>England,</hi> who having been forced to leave <hi>France</hi> upon ſeveral accounts, and durſt not return thither; were in the ſame Condition, except thoſe that were Proteſtants, who altogether took Service under the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William III.</hi>) and were well received by him. But the Catholicks, beſides that they could not expect ſo much favour at his hands, as the others, were unwilling to ſerve a Prince, whom they muſt expect to fight for againſt their natural Sovereign.</p>
               <p>This Officer, of whom I ſpoke before, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of this Opinion, and had always made it his buſineſs to encourage the reſt (who were about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two in number) to perſiſt in this generous Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65930:111"/>
at leaſt till ſuch time they might have an opportunity to try, whether they could not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in their own Country again.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to this extremity, this Officer was ſent to me in the name of all the reſt, and after he had repreſented to me the preſent ill poſture of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he told me, that being inform'd that I was very ſuddenly to return into <hi>France,</hi> they deſired me to ſpeak in their behalf to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and that if in ſome time after they had no favourable Anſwer, neceſſity, which had no Law, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to look out for another Maſter, who would provide for them.</p>
               <p>I highly commended their Reſolution in general, and his in particular. I told him that, to convince him of my readineſs to ſerve them, I would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give them bare Promiſes, but alſo ſomething more ſolid and effectual; that ſince I ſaw that their caſe was ſo urgent, as to admit of no delay, I would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them with what Money I could poſſibly ſpare; and that I was heartily ſorry I was not at preſent in a capacity to do more, and therefore they muſt take my good Will for the Dead. That I would give to each of them fifty Livers, which I hoped might ſerve them ſo long, till I could obtain a favourable Anſwer for them from Court. I deſired them, what ever they did, to keep their own Council, for fear if it ſhould take vent, they might elſe rob themſelves of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65930:112"/>
the benefit of their expected Pardon, by their own Indiſcretion; it was abſolutely neceſſary for me to give them this Precaution, for if it had been known in the leaſt at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court what I had done for them, I ſhould in all probability have loſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of doing Service to our King for the future, whom I was reſolved to oblige as well after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>France,</hi> as I had done whilſt I was in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> This made me once reſolve to give the whole Sum I intended to beſtow upon them to this Officer, for him to diſtribute it among the reſt, by which means I thought to avoid the inconveniency of being known and taken notice of by ſo many; but conſidering his preſent Circumſtances, I began to be afraid, that ſuch a Sum might tempt him to ſomething he would not eaſily be guilty of upon another Account, <hi>I</hi> appointed them all a Meeting, where <hi>I</hi> gave to every one his Share. I had not ſo much Money by me as was requiſite when I made this Promiſe, but a certain Merchant, whoſe Name was <hi>Launai,</hi> who formerly knew me very well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Factor for a Merchant of <hi>Loudun,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Moret,</hi> was very ready to ſupply me with it. After I had given them the Money, <hi>I</hi> deſired each of them to make a <hi>memorandum</hi> what reaſon had made him leave <hi>France,</hi> in what Quality he had ſerv'd there, and ſince in <hi>England</hi> under His <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Majeſty. All theſe <hi>memorandums I</hi> deſired 'em to leave with the before mention'd Officer, who came frequently to ſee me, and was to deliver 'em to me before my departure. The Officer took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Care to get me all theſe <hi>memorandums,</hi> but finding that the Pr. . . . was not ſo forward as <hi>I</hi> had expected to diſpatch me into <hi>France, I</hi> ſent one of my Servants thither to carry and deliver them to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> with ſeveral other Letters; <hi>I</hi> took the opportunity of the Paſs of a <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of my Acquaintance, who took him along with him as his Servant. <hi>I</hi> ſent word to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, That <hi>I</hi> had not receiv'd as yet any Orders to go into <hi>Poictou,</hi> but that I believed it would not be
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65930:112"/>
long before I ſhould receive my laſt Diſpatches, and that therefore if he would ſend me his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I would be ready to receive them at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Servant was ſo ſucceſsful in his Journey, that he paſſed unmoleſted, and delivered my Letters to the Marquis <hi>de Louvois,</hi> in which, among other things, I gave him an Account of what I had done for theſe <hi>French</hi> Officers, with an Intention to be Serviceable to his Majeſty; and I was ſo fortunate, that not one of all the Letters <hi>I</hi> gave him miſcarried, and Fortune continued to ſmile upon me for ſome time longer; for at laſt <hi>I</hi> receiv'd Orders from the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . to begin my Journey. He made me at the ſame time a Preſent of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Guineas from the Pr . . . . and told me, that this was not intended as a Preſent, but only to defray the Charges of my Journey for the preſent, becauſe all my Money had been taken from me at the time when <hi>I</hi> was taken at Sea.</p>
               <p>About two Days before my Departure, a certain <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant, whoſe Name was <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and who was ſent as a Spy into <hi>England</hi> by the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> came to deſire me to take a Niece of his along with me into <hi>France.</hi> He told me, that ſince <hi>I</hi> had but three Servants, and my Paſs expreſſed four, ſhe might paſs very well for one, for provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>I</hi> had no more than my number, no notice would be taken whether they were Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; <hi>I</hi> was not very fond to accept of what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to me; being afraid that this young Woman might prove more troubleſome to me than all the reſt, and that conſequently, <hi>I</hi> might repent of it at leiſure, when it was too late. <hi>I</hi> was not ignorant that moſt of our Refugees in <hi>England,</hi> were an odd ſort of People, and that it was the ſafeſt way to have little or nothing to do with them. <hi>Chriſtian</hi> began to perceive where the Shooe pinched, and gueſſing at the reaſon of it, ſhewed me a Letter written by the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi>'s own Hand, asking me whether I knew it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:65930:113"/>I had no ſooner caſt my Eye upon it, but <hi>I</hi> told him, Since he had ſhew'd me ſo fair a Pledge, I would not only take care of his Niece, but of any thing elſe he ſhould deſire me that might be for his Service. He deſir'd me to take a Supper with him the next Night, which <hi>I</hi> did; and after we had drunk a merry Cup, <hi>I</hi> obſerv'd him ogling his Niece, which made me ſhrewdly ſuſpect there was more Familiarity betwixt them than there is commonly betwixt an Uncle and a Niece. He was ſo vain as to talk likewiſe to me concerning what Buſineſs he was employ'd in by the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> which was alſo a ſhrewd gueſs to me, that he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily Qualified for ſuch an Employment, and that it could not be long before he would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd; as in effect it happened not long after; for he was taken up, and Committed to Priſon by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s (King <hi>William</hi>'s) Orders.</p>

               <p>HAving thus far ſettled my Buſineſs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and every thing being got ready for my Journey into <hi>France, I</hi> left <hi>London,</hi> and took the Niece of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> along with me: Before my Departure, it was agreed upon betwixt the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . and me, that <hi>I</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further Inſtructions from the Pr . . . . by his means, that <hi>I</hi> was to ſend him word from time to time of what News of moment there was in <hi>France,</hi> and he was to do the like to me from <hi>England.</hi> It was ſo agreed betwixt us how to direct our Letters, ſo as that they might paſs ſecurely without the leaſt Suſpicion.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>L</hi> . . . . who was all along of our Cabal, was alſo privy to this, and the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . ordered me to direct all my Letters <hi>I</hi> was to ſend to him, to a certain Gentleman of my Lord

That <hi>I</hi> conſidered, if perhaps <hi>I</hi> ſhould be narrowly ſearched, either at <hi>Dover,</hi> or elſe at my firſt coming into <hi>France,</hi> it muſt turn to our great Prejudice if any thing ſhould be found about me which might give the Enemy an infight into what we deſigned, and ought to keep concealed, is that it would be much the ſafer way to ſend my Papers after me by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Packet-Boat, who might deliver them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my own Hands, if I were ſtill at <hi>Dover,</hi> and if I were not, I would take care to ſend word from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais,</hi> where they ſhould direct my Letters as ſafely as to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I got very well to <hi>Calais,</hi> nothing of moment hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to me in this Journey; I was no ſooner got out of the Packet-Boat, but thoſe that kept Guard near the Port took my Name, and the Sign of the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This was an Anſwer to the ſeveral Letters I had ſent him out of <hi>England.</hi> He told me that his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had been pleaſed to Approve of what I had done, in reſpect of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Officers; that he had had the Goodneſs to Pardon them all their paſt Offences; that I
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65930:114"/>
ſhould order them to repair altogether to <hi>Ireland,</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed, where they ſhould meet with further Orders from the King, with the Count <hi>d'Avaux</hi> his Majeſty's Ambaſſador; as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned my ſelf, I ſhould make what haſt I could to come to Court; where His Majeſty would take care my money I had laid out upon theſe Officers account, ſhould be repaid me; and if I wanted Conveniency for the Directions of my Letters from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Calais,</hi> there was a certain perſon, who had an Employment in the Kings Farms there, unto whom, he ſaid, he had ſent his Commands to do every thing as I ſhould think fit to direct him: That I needed not to make the leaſt ſcruple of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, his recommendation being a ſufficient warrant to me upon that account.</p>
               <p>This Perſon was a Kinſman of Monſieur <hi>de Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ,</hi> Farmer General, and this Monſieur <hi>de Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ</hi> had given him his place. Being fully ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his fidelity after the Recommendation from the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> I writ to my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . to let him know, that it was to this Perſon they ſhould addreſs my Papers, and other Diſpatches they were to ſend me, as knowing him to be a Perſon in whom I could put as much confidence as in my own ſelf: That I had met with him by a lucky chance at <hi>Calais,</hi> and that as long as he ſtaid there, I needed not in the leaſt trouble my ſelf for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Direction, but could reſt ſatisfied, and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Conduct.</p>
               <p>Having thus far ordered every thing according to wiſh, I ſet out on my Journey to <hi>Paris.</hi> As I came to <hi>Boulogne,</hi> the Guards that kept the Gates ask'd me, <hi>who I was, from whence I came, and where I was to lodge.</hi> I gave them a ſatisfactory Anſwer to all, yet ſo as not to diſcover my ſelf. But the Duke <hi>de Aumont,</hi> who was then Governour of that City, and of the whole diſtrict of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> being inform'd that I was come lately out of <hi>England,</hi> and curious to hear what News I brought from thence, ſent to me the Major of the Town, to deſire me to come and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65930:115"/>
pay him a Viſit: His Houſe was in the Lower Town, and as I came to wait on him, one of his Footmen told me, that I might go up to ſee the Duke, without having my Name ſent in to him, which made me go ſtraight ways into his Cloſet, where I found him ſtanding upon a Stool, to look among his Books (of which he had a good number there) for one which he wanted at that time. I no ſooner opened the Door, but he turning his Head towards me, and perceiving an unknown perſon ready to enter his Cloſet, ask'd me briskly, <hi>Who are you?</hi> I anſwered him, I was the perſon he had juſt now ſent for; unto which he reply'd with a haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty look, <hi>ſo that if I had not ſent for you, I ſuppoſe you would ſcarce have given yourſelf the trouble to have come without it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' he was a Perſon of very Eminent Quality, and bore a very high Rank in the Kingdom, yet, as a Gentleman is not obliged to take an Affront from any body, be he never ſo great a Perſon, I began to look upon him with ſuch a Countenance, as might eaſily give him to underſtand that I did not take it in good part, and told him, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I ſhould not have come without his expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that my Buſineſs (which was the occaſion of my preſent Journey) was ſo earneſt and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as that I had no great reaſon to trifle away my time; and that he would oblige me very much, if he would be pleaſed to tell me, in a few Words, what it was he had to command me at this time. He was ſo enraged at this Anſwer of mine, that he told me, tho' my buſineſs were never ſo urgent, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me not to ſtir out of my Inn till further Orders from him. I was forced to obey, and ſo was returning to my Inn extreamly ill ſatisfied with the ill Treatment I had ſo undeſervedly received at his hands, and I took a reſolution to write that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night a very ſmart Letter about it to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> tho' indeed I did not expect any great redreſs from him; for, beſides, that theſe great Perſons are always ſupported by their powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65930:115"/>
at Court againſt any private Perſon, the Duke <hi>d'Aumont</hi>'s firſt Spouſe had been the Marquiſs <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois</hi> own Siſter; the chief account I made of it was, that I might the ſooner have an Anſwer from that Miniſter, which would releaſe me from my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, if the Governor ſhould perſiſt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
               <p>As I was going from his Houſe I happened to meet the Major, whom he had ſent to me before, and underſtanding from him that he was juſt then going to wait on the Duke, I told him, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I had been entertain'd by him, and how he had confin'd me to my Inn; I told him further, that tho' I knew the Duke to be a Perſon who had a great Intereſt at Court, yet I was ſtrangely miſtaken if his Conduct would be approved of there: That I would have him to know, that I was one of the King's Brigadeers, and that perhaps he might not conſider of what conſequence the Buſineſs I was to manage might be to his Majeſty; and, to convince him, that I did not make uſe of this as a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to make my ſelf appear otherwiſe than in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality I was, I ſhew'd him the Superſcription of the Packet, which had been encloſed for me, with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Laubanie,</hi> then Commander in Chief at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he came to the Duke, he gave him an account of what I had told him, and how diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied I was with his ill entertainment, the Duke then began to make ſerious Reflections upon what he had done, and in half an hour after came in perſon to my Inn, under pretence as if he paſs'd that way by chance, and meeting with me in one of the Rooms below ſtairs, told me, That he was ſorry things had happened thus, becauſe I did not tell him who I was: That he had taken me for a Foreigner, and the ſtrict Orders he had received from Court, to keep a watchful Eye upon any of them that ſhould paſs that way, had been the occaſion of the ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he had given me. He deſired me to forget what was paſs'd, and to drink a reconciling Glaſs
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65930:116"/>
with him, which he ask'd me to take with him the ſame night at his Houſe at Supper. He told me, that it being already paſt Three-a-Clock in the Afternoon, I could not go far the ſame night, and that to make me recover what time I ſhould loſe to day, he would have the Gates open'd for me on purpoſe the next morning, as early as I pleas'd.</p>
               <p>This ſudden change made me forget the ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had received before; and I anſwered his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities in very obliging Terms; telling him, that I would not fail to pay him that reſpect I knew was due to him, and would come to Sup with him that night; his reply was, that he deſired me to come pretty early, that he might have the more leiſure to talk with me, concerning what News I could give him from <hi>England.</hi> I went according to my promiſe, and we ſpent the greateſt part of our time in diſcourſing upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, and the preſent Condition of that Court; of which I gave him the beſt Account I was able to do, yet ſo as to be careful not to let him know the leaſt thing of the Secret I had to manage for the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>The next morning I continued my Journey to <hi>Paris;</hi> where we were no ſooner arrived, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to try what metal Monſieur <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Niece was made of. I muſt confeſs it, to my ſhame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering I was a perſon who ſhould have had more ſenſe at that time, being eſpecially a Married Man, and having many Children of my own: But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, what I had obſerved, betwixt her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Uncle and her, that Night I Supp'd with them at <hi>London,</hi> rais'd my paſſion to that Degree, that I could not forbear to attack a Fort, which I did believe would not endure a long Siege; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I found my ſelf not much miſtaken in my gueſs, for ſhe was ſo good natur'd, as to hang out the white Flag at the firſt Summons, and ſoon after ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred at Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>After we began to be more Familiar together, I check'd her one day concerning her amorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65930:116"/>
with her Uncle; ſhe would fain at firſt have denied the whole, but finding that I would not be ſatisfied thus, ſhe at laſt confeſs'd what Familiarity had been betwixt them: but at the ſame time told me that he was none of her Uncle, nay, not ſo much as the leaſt of Kin to her; and that ſhe had only paſs'd, for his Niece in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood ſhould take the leſs notice of their living together; that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> was born in <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſhe in <hi>Angiers,</hi> that he was a Proteſtant and ſhe a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalick;</hi> but that to make her amends for the loſs of her maiden-head, he had brought her over to his Religion.</p>
               <p>Finding her in a good vein to anſwer me every thing I ask'd her, I began to examine her, what buſineſs did bring her at this time to <hi>Paris,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe knew the Contents of thoſe Letters ſhe brought along with her for the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois?</hi> She told me that her Buſineſs was at Court, where ſhe was to wait on the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> in hopes to meet with a ſuitable encouragement to the Service ſhe was going to do his Majeſty; by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to him the infidelity of a certain <hi>Swiſs,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Prancourt,</hi> who being employed as a Spy by the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> did under that notion betray him to the Enemy. That ſhe had ſuch convincing proof of what ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, as was paſt all contradiction, becauſe it was of his own Hand writing.</p>
               <p>She then told me, by what accident ſhe happen'd to come by the ſecret: It ſeems this <hi>Prancourt</hi> was an intimate acquaintance of Monſieur <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and happened to come one Evening (about a fort-night before ſhe left <hi>England</hi>) to ſee and take a merry Cup with him, as they uſed frequently to do. After the Glaſs had gone ſeveral times about, <hi>Prancourt</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her, as ſhe paſs'd accidentally thro' the room where they were, to carry a Letter, which he gave her, to the Poſt-Houſe, becauſe he did not care to ſtir at this time, which ſhe promiſed him to do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully; but in lieu of delivering it to the Poſt,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65930:117"/>
thought fit to keep it, being curious to ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of it, which convinced her that he betray'd the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this Letter being directed to an Uncle of his, who was one of the chief Magiſtrates in one of the Cities belonging to the <hi>Swiſs Cantons,</hi> he gave him notice that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) had granted him a Commiſſion to levy a Regiment of <hi>Swiſs,</hi> at the interceſſion of my Lord <hi>M</hi> . . . . his Wife's Uncle. He deſired him to engage as many Soldiers as he could in the Service, beſides ſeveral Officers, whom he named to him. She further told me, that among other pretty Tricks, her pretended Uncle <hi>Chriſtian</hi> had taught her, how to open and cloſe up again the Seals of Letters, without being perceived by any body, and that ſhe had made uſe of this Art to cloſe up <hi>Prancourt</hi>'s Letter ſo artificially again, that the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> could not ſuſpect the opening of it, and that therefore ſhe hoped for the greater Reward from his hands. She confeſs'd, that ſhe had not ſaid one Word of it to Monſieur <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who, ſhe feared, if he had known it, would have made his own advantage of it, and would have endeavoured, by this Diſcovery, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the favour of that Miniſter, which ſhe believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had pretty well forfeited of late, becauſe he had for ſome time paſt not receiv'd his uſual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from him. That ſhe had improv'd this opportunity to compaſs her own Deſign, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that ſhe would go into <hi>France,</hi> to ſollicit the payment of the Money due to him from Court; which he had agreed to, and charged her with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meſſage, to be delivered by her to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to wit, that he had prevailed with one of the Clerks under the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . , to give him timely Intelligence of any thing of moment, for a good conſideration; ſhe added however, that ſhe would not poſitively affirm it for truth, knowing him to be a Perſon full of vain Conceits, and who would often imagine things quite different from what they really were; beſides, that this might be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65930:117"/>
perhaps invented by him, to ingratiate himſelf at Court, to haſten the payment of his Money.</p>
               <p>When I ſeriouſly Reflected, what a trick this Young Wench was going to put, both upon <hi>Pran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> and her pretended Uncle, I could not but be ſenſible how little confidence I ought to put in her; beſides that I always look'd upon it as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maxim for a Man of Senſe not to rely upon ſuch light Goſſips: Nevertheleſs as it is one of the greateſt defects of Mankind, ſeldom to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned by the misfortunes of others; ſo I was very near to have been catch'd in the ſame Snare as <hi>Prancourt</hi> was, the conſequences of which would have proved as pernicious to me, if I had been as Treacherous as he; of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſay more anon.</p>
               <p>After I came to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> I waited immediately on the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who did not ſee any body that Morning, ſo I went to the Princeſs <hi>de Conti</hi>'s Apartments (one of the Kings Daughters) to ſee whether I could hear any tidings of the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Lieutenant of the Chevalier <hi>de Fourbin.</hi> I found his Father at home, whom I told, that I had been acquainted with his Son in <hi>England;</hi> where we had been both Priſoners at the ſame time; which made him ask me, whether my Name was not <hi>Fontenai?</hi> I having told him it was ſo; and that I was the ſame perſon he meant; he ask'd me how long it was ſince my arrival there, and whether I had been to ſee any body at Court? I anſwered him, That I did not come to <hi>Verſailles</hi> till laſt Night, and had not ſeen any body yet; that indeed I had been that morning to wait on the Marqueſs <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois,</hi> but no body being admitted to ſee him then, I intended to wait on him again after Dinner.</p>
               <p>He then told me, That ſince I had not ſeen him yet, it would be beſt for me not to do it now, till I had paid my reſpects to the King; who, ſaid he, has given me Expreſs Orders ſo ſoon as I ſhould know of your coming, either by my Son, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to conduct you to Monſieur <hi>de la Vienne,</hi> one
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65930:118"/>
of the Four Grooms of his Majeſty's Bed-Chamber, whom he has commanded to preſent you to him at the very Minute he ſees you.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he preſented me to Monſieur <hi>de la Vienne,</hi> who Conducted me into the King's Cloſet, there to expect his return from Maſs. It was not long before the King return'd, who being told by Monſieur <hi>de la Vienne,</hi> that I was in his Cloſet, he entred alone.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing he ask'd me was, what News I brought from <hi>England,</hi> and whether I had any thing more to add to what I had Writ before to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi> After I had given His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty an exact account of every thing that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me in <hi>England,</hi> ſince my laſt Letter to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> I told him likewiſe, that I had brought a Letter from thence Directed to him, and another to the Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For you muſt know, That the Perſon of Quality I ſpoke of before, who came to ſee me Incognito at my Lodgings in <hi>London,</hi> and whom I believed to have altered his Reſolution of ſending his Letters with me, becauſe I had heard no more of him before my departure out of <hi>London,</hi> had only made uſe of this Precaution for his greater ſecurity ſake. For I was no ſooner come to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> but he ſent theſe Letters, and ſeveral others to ſome of his Friends in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at <hi>St. Germain,</hi> by a truſty Friend of his, encloſed in a Letter directed to my ſelf, in which he recommended them to my moſt particular care. Our King ask'd me, from whom theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were, and what I had done with them? I told him, that the Letters came from my Lord . . . . . . and that I had left them in my <hi>Portmanteau,</hi> with an intention to deliver them to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> not knowing that I was to have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſee His Majeſty in perſon.</p>
               <p>After I had given the King a Circumſtantial rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all matters of moment, which happened during my ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> he ordered me to give a full relation of it likewiſe to the Marqueſs <hi>de
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65930:118"/>
Louvois,</hi> who was to Signify to me his further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I went the ſame day after Dinner to wait on the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> again, who eſpying me among the reſt in his Anti-Chamber, as he was going from Dinner into his Cloſet, came to Whiſper me in the Ear, that he was not at leiſure at preſent, but that I ſhould come again at Night about 8 a Clock, when he would be very glad to talk with me.</p>
               <p>Thus I went my ways, and returning at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour, he told me, that I muſt come again the next morning at ſix a Clock: Accordingly I came, and being admitted into his Cloſet, I ſtay'd with him there for above an hour; for after I had given him a full account of the whole matter, he made me Write two Letters in his preſence, one to the E. of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . the other to my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . . I ſent them Word of my ſafe arrival in <hi>Paris,</hi> and that I expected only the laſt Orders from the Pr . . . . to put our deſign in Execution. I gave likewiſe thoſe Letters which my L . . . . . . had ſent after me to <hi>Graveſend,</hi> to this Miniſter, who kept only that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his Majeſty, and return'd the reſt to me, telling me, that I ought to deliver thoſe Letters of my L . . . . to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and to thoſe other Gentlemen they were directed to.</p>
               <p>He gave me at the ſame time, a ſtrict caution not to mention the leaſt thing of my Tranſactions in <hi>England,</hi> either to that Princeſs or any body elſe. Juſt as I was going to take my leave, I told him, that I had brought over with me from <hi>England,</hi> a Niece of Monſieur <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who pretended to have buſineſs of the utmoſt conſequence, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him; that ſhe having deſired me to ask him leave to wait on him; I ſhould be glad to know what Anſwer he was pleaſed to give.</p>
               <p>I took alſo this Opportunity to ſpeak with him concerning My Lord <hi>L . . . . 's</hi> Buſineſs; I told him that the ſaid Lord had deſired me to intercede with him concerning ſome Papers, and other things belonging to him, which as he pretended were taken from him, notwithſtanding he had a Paſs from his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65930:119"/>
Majeſty for their ſafe Conduct; that he had given me a Memorial, containing the whole State of the Caſe, and his Reaſons; and that if he thought fit, to order Reſtitution to be made of them, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that thereby a more firm Correſpondence might be ſettled betwixt him and me, which would much redound to his Majeſty's Service, I would leave this Memorial with him. He anſwered me as to theſe two points; That after my return from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> I ſhould introduce <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Niece to him, and that then alſo I ſhould deliver him the ſaid Memorial.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak the whole truth of the matter, My Lord <hi>L . . . . s</hi> pretenſions were not ſo well founded as he flatterred himſelf; and if it had not been for ſuch a favourable Juncture as this, they would ſcarce have paſs'd for ſufficient for him to have obtain'd his Requeſt. He had been Ambaſſador at the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Emperor had dignified him with the Title of an Earl, which made him go by the ſame Title in <hi>England,</hi> where elſe the eldeſt Son of an Earl cannot pretend to it till after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Death. He had afterwards been ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor into <hi>Spain,</hi> and as he was returning home from thence, had taken his way through <hi>France,</hi> being provided with his Majeſty's Paſs, both for himſelf and his Equipage, which laſt, he cauſed to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd in a Veſſel bound to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where it ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arriv'd not long after. But <hi>Plimouth</hi> being near fourſcore <hi>French</hi> Leagues diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> he had order'd the ſame Equipage which he brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> to be imbark'd again on board another Veſſel, for the cheaper and more convenient Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation to <hi>London,</hi> which being met at Sea by a <hi>French</hi> Privateer, was taken and carried into <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, nevertheleſs, claim'd the ſaid Goods, by virtue of the ſame Paſs, but all his Addreſſes made to the Marquiſs <hi>de Segnelay</hi> upon this account, had proved fruitleſs hitherto; that which was the worſt at preſent, was, that it being ſome time ago, when
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65930:119"/>
the ſaid Prize was taken, and was ſold ſince, there was but little probability for him to recover what he had loſt. But the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who judged not without good reaſon, that this Obligation done to my Lord, by my Interceſſion, would ſerve to promote the King's Service, interpoſed his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſent ſtrict Orders to the Admiralty of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to take effectual care that all thoſe things belonging to my Lord's Equipage, or otherwiſe as were diſpoſed of, might be brought forth. He Wrote alſo to Monſieur <hi>de Laubanie</hi> at <hi>Calais,</hi> to aſſiſt them in the recovery of theſe things; and diſpatch'd Monſieur <hi>de Courchamp</hi> himſelf thither, to ſee his Orders put in Execution. By this means, my Lord had the Satisfaction to recover moſt of his Equipage, there being but very little miſſing; but what was moſt pleaſing to him, was, That all his Papers were reſtored to him without the leaſt Diminution, among which was the Emperors Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by which he had Inveſted him with the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an Earl.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were Tranſacting at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> I took a turn to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court at St. <hi>Germain,</hi> where I delivered to the Queen of <hi>Great Britain</hi> that Letter directed to her from my Lord . . . . . as I did likewiſe the other Letters belonging to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gentlemen of that Court. I found this Princeſs extreamly afflicted at the News ſhe had lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Scotland,</hi> of the Death of my Lord <hi>Dundee.</hi> He was the only Perſon of Quality in that Kingdom, who to teſtifie his Loyalty to King <hi>James,</hi> had taken up Arms for him, and had made his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good againſt the Enemy, as long as he lived, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many excellent Proofs of his Bravery, and there were not a few who were of Opinion, that if he had been timely ſupply'd with Men and Money, with Ammunition and Proviſion as <hi>Ireland</hi> was, he would have acted with better Succeſs there, and might perhaps have carried the terror of his Arms to the very Borders of <hi>England,</hi> it being certain, that with theſe few Men he had under his Command,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65930:120"/>
who had no other Strong-hold but the Mountains he frequently entred the Plains, and ſometimes gave the Alarm to the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> it ſelf; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlain in one of theſe Engagements, his loſs was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed by the whole Court of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> who looked upon him as one of the moſt Faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Royal Maſter.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing I did after my return from St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> was, to introduce Monſieur <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Niece to the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> according to the Orders he had given me the laſt time I ſaw him. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed her in private, and as far as I could find by the Sequel of the Matter, he laid no great ſtreſs upon what they told him concerning the Clerk of the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . For he asked me immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what Opinion I had of this <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> telling me at the ſame time, that he was not at all ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Management. I anſwered him very frankly, That I had but a very indifferent Opinion of his capacity, as well as himſelf; becauſe I found him very defective in point of Prudence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the neceſſary requiſites in a Perſon who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes ſuch a Task as he had done; that beſides this, there was nothing extraordinary, or taking in his whole Perſon, and that a Man need not Talk with him above once or twice to find out his blind ſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But though the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> made no great Reflections upon what Advice had been given him, concerning the Clerk, he ſhewed much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs to unfold the Riddle, in reſpect of <hi>Prancourt.</hi> For which purpoſe, he took the Letter ſhe gave him, which he unſealed neatly, and after he had Peruſed it, and cloſed it up again, ſo as not to be perceived by any Body, ſent it forward to the place whither it was directed, not queſtioning but that this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very might ſtand him in good ſtead for his Majeſty's Service, as indeed it happened ſoon after.</p>
               <p>For his Kinſman, unto whom the Letter was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, ſent a full anſwer to the ſame, which being to go by the way of <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to a Hoſteſs, called <hi>la Perle,</hi> who lived at an
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65930:120"/>
Inn in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> in the <hi>Butchers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> at the Sign of the City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ordered the Poſt-maſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> that as ſoon as ſuch a Letter ſhould come to his Hands, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to no Body but himſelf.</p>
               <p>By this contrivance he made himſelf maſter of the whole Secret, carried on betwixt the Uncle and the Nephew, which was to raiſe a Regiment of <hi>Swiſs</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III's.) Service. The ſame Letter was afterwards Sealed up again. and diſpatched to <hi>Prancourt</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> together, with a Bill of Exchange; which he had no ſooner received, but he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and not having the leaſt miſtruſt of his being diſcovered, but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an augmentation of his Sallary, for ſome late Services, went to wait on the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as he was going from that Miniſter, he was, to his no ſmall ſurprize, taken up by one of the Grand Provoſt's Attendance, who put him into a Coach, and carried him to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> He has continued there a Priſoner ever ſince, and I believe he will not get eaſily out, unleſs it ſhould be by the concluſion of a Peace, if he lives till that time.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> ordered fifty Piſtols to be given to <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Niece; a ſlender Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſo conſiderable a piece of Service; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering eſpecially, that he knew no otherwiſe, but that ſhe had undertaken this Journey at her own coſt and charge, though indeed I defray'd all the Expences. For my part, I was not ſo well reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe; for though this Miniſter could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that I had been ſtrip'd of all what I had by me when I was taken at Sea, he made me not the leaſt Retaliation, imagining perhaps, as I ſuppoſe, that the two hundred Guineas I had from the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . were a ſufficient Recompence for what I had loſt. All that I could obtain, was to have the Money repaid me, which I had given to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned <hi>French</hi> Officers, before I left <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the Banker who had lent me that Money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Word, having drawn a Bill of Exchange
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65930:121"/>
upon me, ſince to the full value of it; nay, I was forc'd to put him twice in mind of it, and to tell him, under what neceſſity I was of anſwering the ſaid Bill of Exchange.</p>
               <p>Thus I had as little reaſon to be ſatisfied with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Niece, and ſhe and I for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency's ſake, Lodg'd together in the ſame Houſe, for which I ought to ask pardon from God Almighty. Notwithſtanding all this, I appear'd every day at Court, in hopes of being employed ſome where or other. One day the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> told me, that my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . had ſent my Commiſſion and other Papers according to the direction I had appointed him at <hi>Calais,</hi> which <hi>Courchamp</hi> had ſent to him, together with a Letter from the ſaid Lord, to me. There was among them another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Pr . . . . . by vertue of which I was conſtituted Governour of the firſt place, that ſhould be taken in <hi>Poictou,</hi> or in any part of <hi>France,</hi> after their landing. He delivered them all together into my own hands; and at the ſame time made me write again two Letters in his preſence, to the ſame two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, I had Writ to before.</p>
               <p>They were both dated in <hi>Paris,</hi> as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the two former, and contained in ſubſtance, that, being fallen ill two days after my arrival in this City, I could not immediately purſue my intended Journey into <hi>Poictou,</hi> that nevertheleſs being not unmindful of what I had to do, I had met with ſeveral Gentlemen of that Province, whom I had found as great Favourers to our deſign, as I could wiſh for, and did not queſtion but that their concurrence would be of greater conſequence to us in that Country. I told them further, that being on the mending hand now, I did not queſtion, but to be able to give them before long a more compleat account of the matter, to their entire ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>I gave likewiſe an Account to my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . what ſucceſs I had met with in his Affairs, in the ſame manner as I have related it juſt now; having
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65930:121"/>
not Writ to him before upon that Subject, becauſe I was very cautious of Writing any thing to them without their Knowledge, nay, even without the poſitive Orders of the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi> I did not ſend theſe Letters to the Poſt-houſe at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> but took the Copy of them along with me to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I tarried two days, whilſt the King and Court were at <hi>Marli.</hi> After I had Writ them over, I enclos'd them in one Packet, with an intention to carry them the ſame Night to the Poſt-Houſe. But Monſieur <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s pretended Niece, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee them lie upon the Table, told me ſhe would ſave me that labour, and carry them for me, ſhe being alſo to ſend a Letter to her Uncle.</p>
               <p>Knowing how ſhe had ſerv'd <hi>Prancourt,</hi> I ought ſooner to have thrown them into the Fire, than truſted her with them; but having not the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that ſhe would ſerve me the ſame trick. I told her, without the leaſt heſitating upon the matter, That, if ſhe pleas'd ſhe might, but deſired her withal to make haſte back again. But ſhe play'd me the ſame P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anck as ſhe had done to the <hi>Swiſs</hi> before; for in lieu of carrying the Packet to the Poſt-Houſe, ſhe kept it, and taking the next oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, whilſt I was gone into the City, unſealed the Letters, and after ſhe had ſeen the Contents of them reſolved to preſent them to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois:</hi> In the mean time we continued our former familiarity, and ſhe careſs'd me to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the better to diſſemble her deſign againſt me; a convincing inſtance of the deceitfulneſs of ſuch light Creatures! She had the cunning to deſire me, to take her along with me the firſt time I ſhould have occaſion to go to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> under pretence that ſhe intended to deliver a Petition to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> in order to obtain ſome further Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I was ſo far from ſuſpecting her intention, that I freely carried her thither, when ſhe took this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to deliver theſe Letters into this Miniſters own hands, not queſtioning, but that by this ſecond piece of Service, ſhe had made her Fortune for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65930:122"/>But if ſhe had found her ſelf deceived in her firſt hopes about <hi>Prancourt</hi>'s Letter, ſhe had this as an additional Affliction for her pains, that ſhe was not rewarded with the value of a Peny for this.</p>
               <p>I for my part met with ſo cold a Reception from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> the next time I ſaw him, that I don't at all queſtion, but this miſtake turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my great detriment ever after. And to ſpeak Truth, what Opinion can a Wiſe Miniſter have, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I did what poſſibly I could to diſſemble my Reſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Treacherous Wench whilſt I was in his preſence, but he ſoon perceived the different Paſſions which ſtruggled within me, and I verily believe he gueſs'd at the whole Matter, and what Familiarity there uſed to be betwixt us; for he forbid me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly not to mention one word of it to her; for, ſays he, if you do ſo, ſhe will be ſure you muſt have it from me; and when ſhe perceives that I let you go unpuniſhed, what other Conſtruction can ſhe make of the whole, (unleſs ſhe be quite a Fool) but that theſe Letters were written by you with my conſent. He told me further, that he was unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved what he had beſt to do in the matter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ought not to have me taken up, for fear ſhe ſhould elſe gueſs at the Intrigue, when ſhe found me to come off thus unpuniſhed, after what ſhe had convinced him of againſt me. That I had put him, by this Imprudence of mine, to a great Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, and that I deſerved to be ſeverely Chaſtized for it.</p>
               <p>I cannot deny but that if he had ſent me to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> I ſhould have looked upon it as a Chaſtize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had very well deſerved at his Hands, at this time, when his words had made ſo deep an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon my mind, that I durſt not look up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Face; and if it had not been for his expreſs Commands, it would have been impoſſible for me to have kept my ſelf within the bounds of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reſpect of this Treacherous Wretch. But
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65930:122"/>
being full of Shame and Confuſion, I could ſay no more, than to beg him to forgive me this Fault; and though I always had a natural averſion to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; yet I maſter'd my Paſſion ſo far, as not to gave the leaſt Suſpicion of it to the young Wench. Nay, though I hated her ever after to the higheſt degree, I would not ſend her away immediately, but reſolved to take another opportunity to rid my Hands of her, for fear ſhe ſhould gueſs at the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was at <hi>Paris,</hi> I had preſented to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> a Memorial, containing the Names of all thoſe Gentlemen, who, according to what had been related by the above-mentioned two <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Miniſters, were ready to do, and hazard every thing for the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion. The ſame Memorial likewiſe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the principal Deſign of the Enemy, was at that time, upon <hi>Port Lowis,</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> which they believed to be but ill provided; and where, by reaſon of the ſmall Garriſon, they judged they might moſt conveniently make a Deſcent, provided, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Alteration ſhould be made thereabouts in the mean while.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that they had very well taken their Meaſures, for beſides that there was a very weak Garriſon in the Place, the Coaſt thereabouts was ſo high, and the Water in many places ſo deep, that they might have made a Deſcent with a great deal of eaſe. Both the King and the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> were extreamly netled at this piece of News; for though it was in their power to provide the place with a better Garriſon, it was beyond their Art to alter the Situation of the Coaſt, which was very proper for a Deſcent; for there is a Bay about two or three <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Miles diſtant from the Town, where there is five and thirty foot of Water, and where conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the biggeſt Ships may approach the Shoar, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much danger. There were at that time no Forts thereabouts, though I don't queſtion, but ſome have been Erected there ſince. There was no
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65930:123"/>
other Defence at that time but a Body of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, who were not in a Capacity to have made any Reſiſtance by themſelves, and the Garriſon being not ſtrong enough to ſecond them; it muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity follow, that in caſe the Enemy had without delay put their Deſign in Execution, they might not only have Landed here, but alſo have burnt all the Ships, which lay at Anchor in another Bay behind the Fort; there being nothing that could prevent their Marching thither by Land. They might have at the ſame time ſet fire to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Houſe, which is not five <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles diſtant from <hi>Port-Lowis,</hi> and without any Defence, unleſs they had judg'd it more for their purpoſe to have carry'd off theſe precious Commodities in their Veſſels.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, I was none of the King's Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Council at that time, neither ought I to pretend to dive into the Secret of the greateſt Prince who has for many years ſway'd the Scepter of <hi>France,</hi> and of ſo Wiſe and Politick a Miniſter as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> nevertheleſs, I am almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that I am not much out of the way when I ſhall tell you that it was debated in Council whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not convenient to take up thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe Names were inſerted in the Memorial I had preſented to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> which might ſerve as a Signal to the Enemy, that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had been diſcovered, or whether it would be more proper to diſſemble the Matter for ſome time longer, till they might receive better Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning them. For as great a Politician a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither do I believe my ſelf to be in the wrong, when I ſhall further tell you, that there was a third Propoſition made in the Council; to wit, whether it would not be moſt proper for me to be ſeiz'd, by which means they might avoid to call ſo many Gentlemen to an account, againſt whom, they had as yet, no poſitive Proof of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65930:123"/>
the Enemy's Deſign; that ſo by the making a Sacrifice of one unfortunate Perſon, they might ſave a great deal of trouble to the State, and at the ſame time give the Enemy to underſtand, that their Mine had taken Vent.</p>
               <p>It is beyond all Queſtion, that they believing me entirely devoted to their Service, could not have ſuppoſed otherwiſe, but that their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had been diſcovered, and queſtionleſs, would have laid aſide this Enterprize; being bereaved of all the likelihood they had of ſucceeding in it, by this ſuppoſed diſcovery.</p>
               <p>But whether the King whoſe goodneſs, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice are the moſt ample Subject of Admiration, to all the World, would not make uſe of either of theſe extreams, without firſt trying other means, or whether the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> had ſome other deſign in his Head (as I am apt to believe, by what I know ſince) he ask'd me not long after, whether I underſtood the whole Art of Fortifications? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, That indeed I had ſome inſight into it, but not ſo as to pretend to be a Compleat En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer; I made him this Anſwer, which I had pitch'd upon, as the moſt ſuitable to the Deſign which I ſuppoſed he had againſt me; to wit, to make me a Sacrifice to ſave many others; or elſe out of a piece of Policy, to divert me from making any further account, upon what I might reaſonably pretend to have deſerved at his hands, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I had done.

               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:65930:124"/>I was in the greateſt uncertainty that could be, to gueſs at his deſign; for it ſeem'd to me, that to beſtow ſo publick an Employment on me in ſight of all the Proteſtants thereabouts, amongſt whom I was afterwards to act the part of an Emiſſary from the Pr. . . would be but a ſlender inducement for them to truſt me with their Lives and Eſtates. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this Miniſter intended to make uſe of me as an Evidence, againſt ſuch of them as he believed real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty, and had a mind to take off, or perhaps this was a State's Trick to ſpoil my Credit among them, for fear that if I ſhould find them diſpos'd to a Revolt in the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> I might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to change Party, and ſide in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) in hopes to make my Fortune under him; for which reaſon alſo one Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> was to be joined with me in Commiſſion, who was to keep a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye over all my Actions.</p>
               <p>This Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> had formerly ſerv'd the King, but it was a great while ſince; ſo that there was but little probability that the Marqueſs <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois</hi> ſhould have pitch'd upon this Perſon for ſuch an Employment, and preferr'd him before others then actually in the King's Service, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that were his Creatures, if there had not been ſome myſtery in the bottom. He was ſtiled in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Commiſſion <hi>Surveyor General,</hi> a Title to which, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, he could not in the leaſt pretend, conſidering that he had never born a Commiſſion above the degree of a Captain of Foot, and that a conſiderable time ago. Nevertheleſs to give him his due, he was a very genteel Perſon, well verſed in the Military Art, and who beſides that had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good Qualification, which to me is preferable to all the reſt, that is, he was a very pious Man; and he uſed frequently to diſcourſe to me upon that point, ſo that it was my own fault if I did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his good Counſel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:65930:124"/>The Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> when he firſt ſpoke to me about him, had given me a very different Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him, from what I found him to be; for he told me, that he did not rely much upon his ability, but what he did was meerly upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the Princeſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> unto whom he could not deny ſuch a favour. But whoever knows the true Character of this Miniſter, cannot but be ſenſible that it is his conſtant Maxim, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the King's Service before all the Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the World; ſo that the more I ponder the matter, the more I am perſwaded there was ſome myſtery in it.</p>
               <p>But however it be, I received Orders from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> to prepare for my immediate departure; and he told me in perſon, that he wou'd not have me tarry at all at <hi>Paris,</hi> and no more than three days at my own houſe in the Country; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King's preſent Service required more than ordinary diſpatch. I took this opportunity to rid my hands of my female Companion, of whom I have ſpoken before, and told Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> that he muſt be ready by the next morning early. He told me, it was impoſſible for him ſo to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither Horſes nor Money; and deſired me therefore to allow him only two days to provide himſelf with both, and to diſpatch ſome other Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of conſequence, after which he would without delay go along with me. Conſidering that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> was not likely to be inform'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we tarried a day longer or not I thought I could not very well refuſe him ſo reaſonable a requeſt, not imagining that ever it would come to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: But whether this Miniſter had taken parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care to be inform'd of what I did, and how ſtrict I would be in obſerving his Orders, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> himſelf had given him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, how complaiſant I had been to him I can't tell; but certain it is, that the very next day after he writ me a very ſevere Letter about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65930:125"/>Thus I was forced to get immediately on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and I agreed with Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> to ſtay two days for him at <hi>Samur,</hi> to expect his coming there; and that, if he did not come by that time, I intended to proceed alone in my Journey, without as much as calling at my own Home. Yet being very deſirous to ſee my Family, I ſent word to my Spouſe to come and meet me at <hi>Samur,</hi> with our Children, at a prefix'd time, where I might enjoy them for a little while, without loſing any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of proceeding in my Journey. Accordingly my Spouſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with our whole Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> met me at the appointed Time and Place, and inform'd me, how one, whoſe Name was <hi>des Iſles Montaut,</hi> had put her under a great perplexity, having told her, whilſt I was a priſoner in <hi>England,</hi> that I had engaged my ſelf in the Service of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III.) and that if ſhe had followed his Advice, ſhe muſt have made a ſtrange piece of Work of it, which both ſhe and I might have repented of ſince.</p>
               <p>This <hi>des Iſles Montaut</hi> was a Counſellor of <hi>Loudun,</hi> a Man of no Eſtate, but of a conſiderable ſhare of Wit, if deſigning and tricking may be called by that name. By this means he had got together above Fifty thouſand Crowns, which he had ſqueez'd out of the Widows and Orphans, and was therefore but in a very ſlender Repute, as to his Honeſty, all over that Province. As Charity is almoſt baniſh'd from the Race of Mankind, and that moſt People take much more pains to divulge the Defects of their Neighbours than to hide them. I had his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter told me, the very firſt time I came to <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun.</hi> But truſting more to my own skill than to others, I was ſo inveigled by the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his modeſt and civil Behaviour, (he being a great maſter in the Art of Diſſimulation) that I took all what I had heard of him for malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. He was one of the firſt who ſhew'd the moſt eagerneſs to perſwade me to ſettle in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and took a great deal of pains to find out an
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65930:125"/>
Eſtate fit for my purpoſe, he being the perſon who made the Bargain for the Eſtate I am now poſſeſs'd of, of which I had a very good penny-worth. For ſuch was his feign'd honeſty, that the Perſon from whom I was to buy the Eſtate, having promiſed him fifty Piſtoles if the Bargain ſucceeded, he told me of it before we agreed about the Purchaſe.</p>
               <p>After I was put into poſſeſſion of the Eſtate, he offer'd himſelf to be my Seneſhal, or Chief Judge, of that Precinct belonging to my Juriſdiction, which I eaſily granted him, he having not given me the leaſt occaſion hitherto to change the good Opinion I had conceived before of his Honeſty. I told him however, as I was going to inveſt him with it, that if I ſhould have conſulted the common Vogue of the People, I ought not to have put him in this place; nay, I ought not to have admitted him to come into my Houſe; and that therefore I deſired him ſo to behave himſelf in it, both in reſpect to my ſelf, and others, whoſe Buſineſs he was to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, that he might give, by his fair dealing, the Lye to all his Adverſaries. He anſwer'd me in ſuch a manner, as did not a little encreaſe in me the good Opinion I had conceived of him before, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpite of the ill reputation he had amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; For he told me, that he was not in the leaſt ſurprized at the malicious Aſperſions his Enemies did put upon him, ſince he knew that our Saviour himſelf could not eſcape the cenſure of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: and that he only begg'd of me to ſuſpend my Judgment, and not to condemn him before I was convinced by his future Behaviour, of the truth of what they had laid to his Charge.</p>
               <p>By theſe Inſinuations he at laſt got ſuch an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over me, that I entirely confided in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and ſcarce ever did any thing without taking firſt his advice. Then it was he began to play his parts, for he perſwaded me to purchaſe ſeveral Farms, which were not far from my Seat; but in lieu of letting me have a Penny-worth, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were, he made me purchaſe them at
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65930:126"/>
an exceſſive rate; for he uſed to make his Bargain before hand with thoſe that were to ſell, that in caſe he could get them ſuch a Sum, he was to have ſuch a ſhare for himſelf; by which means he got above ten Thouſand Livres of my Money.</p>
               <p>But he ſerved me a worſe Trick than all this; for he perſwaded me to put out a Sum of thirty three thouſand Livres to a certain Merchant of <hi>Samur,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>du Montiere,</hi> from whom he had a very conſiderable Reward for his pains. I was ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of this <hi>des Iſles</hi>'s Honeſty, who told me that it was more ſafe in his Hands than in my own, and that I might always have it at command, as I ſhould meet with any Purchaſe for my purpoſe, that I let him have it without paying any Intereſt for it. But this Merchant happening to die ſome time after, I loſt ſeven thouſand Livres by him, which he had of mine left in his Hands, I ſhould never have done, if I ſhould go about to give you an Account of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Artifices this Counſellor made uſe of to catch me in the Trap, which indeed he might do with a great deal of eaſe; conſidering I had left the whole Management of my Affairs to his Conduct. But at laſt he ſo groſly abuſed the Confidence I had put in him, that the Veil which hitherto had been before my Eyes, being removed, I began plainly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how he had dealt with me, and therefore I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to an Account for his Miſcarriages.</p>
               <p>I will relate but one more of his cheating Tricks, which may ſerve as a patern for all the reſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen Years ago he procured me the Purchaſe of a Farm near my Houſe, which belonged to a Proteſtant Gentleman of that Country; he himſelf drew the Deeds betwixt me and the Seller, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, engaged himſelf in a Bond to ſurrender the ſaid Farm to me free from all Incumbrances on his behalf, which alſo this Lawyer ſigned as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Notwithſtanding all which, about ſix years after, (ſomething leſs, or more) when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that I was a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> (of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſay more hereafter) I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65930:126"/>
in a very troubleſome Law Suit upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, under pretence, that he had lent ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon the Eſtate. The Duke <hi>de Mazarine,</hi> to whom I owe many and great Obligations, has ſince interpoſed his Authority, and propoſed that it might be left to his Arbitration: But not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any longer upon his Treacherous Dealings, I will return where I left off before, and put you in mind, that it was this prefidious Wretch, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got ſome notice, by what means, I know not, that I had been taken and carried a Priſoner into <hi>England,</hi> made my Spouſe the above mentioned Complement. He began to talk to her at ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a rate, that though ſhe was a Native of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> (who among us are not looked upon as the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) yet had foreſight enough to take care that ſhe might have a Witneſs to what he ſaid; ſhe happened then to be at <hi>Montrevil Bellai,</hi> a ſmall City in our Neighbourhood, where I uſed conſtantly to paſs the greateſt part of the Winter, in a Houſe of my own, which I have there to this Day. She pretended to this tricking Councellor, that being obliged by ſome ſudden Accident, to leave him for a Moment, ſhe begg'd his Excuſe, but took this Opportunity to ſend immediately to another Lawyer of our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in that City, whoſe Name being <hi>Eſquinurin,</hi> ſhe deſired him to come to her immediately, upon ſome Buſineſs of very great Conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſquinurin</hi> being come accordingly, ſhe had only ſo much time as to tell him that he ſhould go into a Cloſet ſhe ſhew'd him, which being parted only by a ſingle Wainſcoat from the Room where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councellor was, ſhe deſired him to take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of what he ſhould hear. Then ſhe returned into the Room where ſhe had left him, and after having once more begg'd his Excuſe, ſhe ſent my eldeſt Daughter out of the Room, who had Entertain'd him the mean while ſhe was abſent. She then began a freſh to enter upon the ſame Diſcourſe, and the Councellor alſo continued to ſing his old Tune, to wit, That without all queſtion, the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65930:127"/>
King would ſeize upon our Eſtate, as ſoon as he had notice that I had engaged my ſelf in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s (King <hi>William</hi> III.) Service. That he knew but one way to avoid this Misfortune, which threatned our entire Ruin; which was to ſell it, as ſoon as poſſibly could be done; that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Purchaſer, but under-hand, give her a Deed of Truſt, in which he would declare the ſame for our uſe, thereby to exclude his Heirs, in caſe he ſhould happen to die in the mean while, from any Legal Pretenſion to the Succeſſion. He told her, that after this was done, ſhe might with her whole Family go over into <hi>England,</hi> where he would be as Serviceable to her in her abſence, as if ſhe were preſent in <hi>France.</hi> He adviſed her alſo, that this being to be look'd upon as an occaſion preſented to her by God's peculiar Providence, to reconcile her ſelf to that Church ſhe was born and educated in, and which ſhe had abandoned ſince, ſhe ought to make uſe of it at this time; which if ſhe ſhould neglect to do, ſhe muſt expect to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a ſevere Account about it, by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>He could not have given me a greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over him than this, at ſuch a Juncture, when to perſwade a Perſon to change her Religion, and to leave the Kingdom with her Family, is looked upon in <hi>France,</hi> as one of the worſt Crimes that can be committed. I wrote therefore a Letter upon his account to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to deſire him by ſome means or other to deliver me and the whole Province from a Perſon, who by his Intrigues, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt brought me to the brink of ruin.</p>
               <p>This Miniſter was pleaſed to eſpouſe my Cauſe, and after I had ſent him a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> containing many Grievances, both in reſpect of my ſelf, and other Gentlemen of that Country, againſt this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, he diſpatch'd his Orders to Monſieur <hi>de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,</hi> then Intendant of the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to make a ſtrict Examination concerning his Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and if he found him guilty of what was laid
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65930:127"/>
to his Charge, to have him made an Example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Next Day I continued my Journey to <hi>Port Lowis,</hi> for Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> was by this time come to <hi>Samur,</hi> according to his Promiſe. As we paſs'd through <hi>Nantes,</hi> I went to ſee a certain Merchant there, unto whom I uſed ſometimes to ſell my Wines; he told me among other things, that he had underſtood that whilſt I was lately in <hi>London,</hi> I had got into very good Acquaintance there, and that if any of my Friends had Intereſt enough at that Court to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Paſs for a certain Quantity of <hi>French</hi> Wines and Brandies to be Imported there, he would not only buy all the Wines I had by me, at a very good Price; but alſo beſides this, make me a Preſent of a thouſand Piſtoles.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, ſuch a Wind-fall as this, would have been very welcome to me at that time; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, a thouſand Piſtols don't come amiſs to any Body, eſpecially in theſe hard Times; I had all the Wines in my Cellar, which were made ſince the beginning of this War, becauſe the Trade with <hi>Holland,</hi> whither the Wines of our Country uſed to be moſt Tranſported, was quite interrupted; which had reduced many Gentlemen in the Country to a Starving Condition, who, though they had great plenty of Wines in their Cellars, yet were not able to raiſe any Money upon them to ſupply their preſent occaſions.</p>
               <p>I told the Merchant, that I would try what I could do, and at the ſame time writ a Letter to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acquainted him with what had been propoſed to me by the Merchant at <hi>Nantes,</hi> and that conſidering the preſent Circumſtances of my Affairs, he could not put a greater Obligation upon me at this time, than to give me leave to take this occaſion of getting a Preſent of a thouſand Piſtols, and at the ſame time to rid my Hands of a great ſtore of Wines I had by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:65930:128"/>He ſent me a very obliging Anſwer, even beyond what I deſired, or expected; for he told me, that he would gratifie me in this point of getting a thouſand Piſtoles; and that for that purpoſe, he would ſend me a Paſs from the <hi>French</hi> Court, without which, no Veſſel durſt ſtir out of the Port at this time. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adviſed me, to endeavour to make the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant allow me a more conſiderable Reward for ſo extraordinary a Favour, a thouſand Piſtols being not an Equivalent to what he was likely to get by the Bargain.</p>
               <p>After I had received this Letter, I thought my ſelf as good as ſecure of the Money, not queſtioning in the leaſt, but that my Intereſt was ſo great in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, (where I knew they would be very glad to oblige me in a thing that ſtood them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) as to obtain there what I deſired. I ſent therefore word to the Merchant, that he might rely upon it; who thinking himſelf now ſure of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, bought up great Quantities of Wine for that purpoſe, and offered to lay down ready Money for the three hundred Pipes, which I told him I had in my Cellar; but I would not accept of it, till I had procured him the Paſs. Not but that ſuch a Sum would have come very ſeaſonably to me, at a time when I was in great want of Money; But though I had ſaid no more than what was actually true, when I had told him, I had three hundred Pipes of Wine in my Cellar, nevertheleſs, it was at that time not altogether at my own diſpoſal. For you muſt know, that ſome of my Vine-yards being let to a Farmer, great part of it belonged to him, but he owed me three years Rent, and was not in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to pay me, becauſe he could not ſell his Wines, which made me look upon the Wines as good as my own.</p>
               <p>The better to keep my Promiſe with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, I writ to my Wife, to deſire her to take the ſaid Wines in part of Payment at a current Price, and to take the Vine-yards into her own hands, the Farmer being very-willing to be diſcharged of them.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65930:128"/>
She very readily did what I deſired, becauſe I had given her an Account of what proſpect I had to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my Wines at a good Advantage, and to get a good Sum of Money beſides.</p>
               <p>It is a natural defect to all Mankind to be apt to flatter themſelves in thoſe Matters which appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their own Sentiments, or Intereſt; this made me build Caſtles in the Air, and to live in hopes that I might meet ſeveral times with the ſame Opportunity of getting a round Sum of Money here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But I was ſoon convinced of the vanity of my hopes; for the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to whom I had ſent ſince that time a Letter directed to the Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . in <hi>England,</hi> in which, I deſired him to procure me a Paſs from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, by which means, I might rid my hands of moſt of my Effects in <hi>France,</hi> which otherwiſe, (in caſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhould ſucceed) I was in danger of loſing; I ſay the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> in lieu of ſending me the Lord <hi>L . . . . s</hi> Anſwer, which was according to my deſire, (as I was convinced afterwards, to wit, ofter my return from our Journey,) ſent me word that he had weighed the Matter ſince, and upon more mature Deliberation, found it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to be done.</p>
               <p>This Letter was no leſs vexatious than ſurprizing to me, and put me to the greateſt Nonplus that could be imagined. For, beſides that, nothing touches one more narrowly than to be diſappointed in the hopes of a thing which one thought to be poſſeſſed of already; I had now many Vine-yards and great ſtores of Wines lying upon my hands, of which I could in all likelihood not make the leaſt Profit; on the other hand, I had by my Credulity, occaſioned to the Merchant of <hi>Nantes</hi> conſiderable Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, who relying upon my Word, had bought up ſuch a vaſt quantity Wines, as conſidering the preſent circumſtances of Affairs, could not but be a great Charge to him. I was ſo ſtartled at this ill Succeſs, that <hi>I</hi> did not know where to turn my ſelf firſt, and what Excuſes to make to a Man, to whom
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65930:129"/>
I had given my abſolute promiſe, as looking upon the thing as infallible, after the kind anſwer I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was juſt at <hi>Port Lowis</hi> when I received this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal News; and I muſt confeſs, had it not been for Monſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> my fellow Commiſſioner, who did me all the good Offices he could, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have been apt to do ſomething or other I might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of hereafter. He gave me at that time moſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proofs of his Charitable Inclinations and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but the laſt Night before we came to <hi>Port Lowis,</hi> there happened an Accident to us, which made me believe that thoſe Devout and Zealous Gentlemen don't care to look Death in the Face any more than other People.</p>
               <p>This happened in a certain Inn, not above three <hi>French</hi> Leagues from <hi>Port-Lowis;</hi> in ſo miſerable a place that it afforded nothing but a few Eggs for our Supper, and at our firſt Entrance into the Inn, you might ſee Miſery painted in ſuch lively Colours in the very Hoſteſſes Face, that without going to a Conjurer, it was eaſie for us to gueſs what Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we were likely to meet with in ſuch a By-place as this; to be ſhort, when we enquired what we could have for Supper, the Anſwer was, That they were but very ill provided to entertain many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</p>
               <p>So we were forced to be contented with a few herbs, miſerably dreſſed, and a new laid Egg each of us. After Supper we went up Stairs into a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Hole, which they called a Bed-chamber, and our Servants went to Supper with the Hoſteſs, who fry'd them ſome ſorry Pan-cakes with Bacon.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were at Supper together, the Hoſt came home as Drunk as a Lord, and the firſt thing he did, was to fall about his Wife's Ears, whom he called Whore, and other ſuch like pretty names; a convincing Inſtance, that a Drunken Man does not ſtick at any thing; as will appear by the Sequel of our Relation.</p>
               <p>Our Servants ſeeing the drunken Fellow make ſuch a havock in the Houſe, got away as faſt as they
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65930:129"/>
could into the Stables, and after they had Dreſſed their Horſes, came up ſtairs, without telling us any thing of what had paſſed below.</p>
               <p>So to Bed we went, and our Servants did the like in the ſame Room with ours, being divided only from us by a ſlender Partition. We were juſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len aſleep, when the ſame drunken Fellow got up Stairs knocking at our Door like a Mad-man, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Swearing he would be revenged upon us for the Affront we had put upon him, or that he would die in the Attempt.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> being firſt awakened by the noiſe he made, and finding me faſt aſleep, began to pull me by the Arm, and to tell me that we were certainly got into an Inn where they uſed to cut Peoples Throats, and that he was afraid we ſhould not eſcape their Hands. He made our Servants riſe at the ſame time, who then told us what Game he had play'd before below Stairs, and that they looked upon him as a deſperate mad Fellow, who would ſtick at nothing. But Monſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> who was ſo prepoſſeſſed with Fear, that he could not be perſwaded that this was the effect of his Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, told me plainly, he believed, he only came to pick a Quarrel with us, to take that Opportunity to cut our Throats, and whether I had a mind to be Murdered in my Bed like a Woman, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had not better prepare for a vigorous Defence. The truth is, I had hitherto not given my ſelf the trouble to ſtir, believing that it was only the fumes of the hot Liquors, which had diſturbed the Fellows Brains, which would ſoon paſs over; and that therefore we need not trouble our ſelves much about it.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were thus arguing the point, <hi>I</hi> heard a great noiſe upon the Stairs, becauſe, as it ſeems, the Woman of the Houſe had called in ſome of the Neighbours to endeavour to get him down Stairs. But Monſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> whoſe fear encreaſed with the noiſe, begun to be angry with me in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65930:130"/>
becauſe <hi>I</hi> was not as fearful as he. To pleaſe him, <hi>I</hi> got at laſt out of the Bed, and whilſt he and our Servants were as buſie as could be in Charging and Cocking their Piſtols, no otherwiſe than if they were to have Engaged a Squadron of Horſe, I went to liſten at the Door, where I ſoon underſtood what was the occaſion of the noiſe upon the Stairs. I then began to laugh at his fearfulneſs; but let me do what I could, it was impoſſible for me to perſwade him out of it; for though all was quiet in the Inn immediately after, he could not be prevailed upon to go to Bed himſelf, neither would he let the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants go to ſleep all that Night.</p>
               <p>The Hoſt, after he had recovered his Senſes the next Morning, was ſo much aſhamed of what he had done, that he durſt not appear to us, but ſent his Wife to beg our Pardon for his laſt Nights miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and I had the Satisfaction to laugh at Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>de Vaux</hi> all the way till we came to <hi>Port-Lowis.</hi> Our Orders were addreſſed to the Duke of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who was both Governour and Lord of the Place. But about two days before our arrival, he had been commanded by the King to leave it, and to retire to his Principality of <hi>Mayenne.</hi> He was beholding for this removal, to Monſieur <hi>de Beaureguard,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Governour of the Place, who from being a Domeſtick to the Duke <hi>de la Meilleraie,</hi> was become his Favourite, and was obliged to him for his whole Fortune, and now had paid thus his Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Duke, his Son, under pretence that his Bigottry would prove prejudicial to the King's Service.</p>
               <p>He had ſent ſeveral Letters to Council, in which he had acquainted them, that this Godly Man, (as he called the Duke) had preſented all the Officers of the Garriſon, each with a ſmall Golden Croſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Condition that they ſhould wear it in the ſame place as the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> do, and had engaged them to agree, That as often as any one of them ſhould miſs to wear it ſo, he ſhould be obliged to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65930:130"/>
pay a Crown every time to the Poor; That thoſe Officers who, more out of Complaiſance to the Duke than any other Motive, had accepted of them, having miſs'd to wear them ſometimes, he had not only made them pay a Crown a piece for every time, but alſo had looked frowningly upon them, when they came to pay their Reſpects to him.</p>
               <p>He had further told them, that the beſt Paſs a Man could have to be admitted to the Duke's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was this Golden Croſs, and that let an Officer be never ſo well qualified for the King's Service, yet if he did not wear this Badge of Piety, (which he preferred before all other Qualifications) he would meet but with a cold Reception at his hands. He had inform'd the Court alſo, that the Duke had commanded all the Officers of that Garriſon, under pain of an Arreſt, to be at home by ten a Clock at Night, whereby he had depriv'd them of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Divertiſements, ſuch as Balls, and other ſuch like Aſſemblies, which are allowable by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Conſent of the Nation. That he had put an Officer under an Arreſt becauſe he had ſeen him whilſt he was at Maſs, talking: more familiarly with a young Woman than he believed was conſiſtent with what reſpect ought to be paid to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the place where they were at that time.</p>
               <p>Thus Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard</hi> had put a wrong Interpretation upon the Duke's Actions, which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no more than to make his Officers pious and good Men, juſt as if Piety and Valour were incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with one another; and that a Perſon truly Pious could not be truly Brave. But however it be, this Gentleman, who pretended to be ſo Zealous for the King's Service when he was to obſerve the Actions of others, did not prove ſo, (at leaſt in my Opinion) when he preferred his own Diverſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; for when we came to <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> he was abſent from his Poſt; for he had taken a Journey of Pleaſure to <hi>Breſt,</hi> in Company of Madam <hi>Sybret</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:65930:131"/>
and her Husband, who was Director General of the <hi>French Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and who beſides that, had ſeveral other great Employments, which made him to be looked upon at Court as a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſon.</p>
               <p>The Major, who then Commanded in Chief in the Place, was a Perſon of ſo indifferent an Aſpect, and whoſe Character we found ſuitable to his Aſpect, that neither Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> nor I would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate our Buſineſs to him. All we did, was to tell him, that we were ſent thither by the King upon ſome Buſineſs of Conſequence, and that as ſoon as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Beauregard</hi> ſhould return from <hi>Breſt,</hi> we would ſhow him our Commiſſions, and what Orders we had from Court; we ſhould ſcarce have vouchſafed to tell him ſo much, if we had not been obliged ſo to do, for fear of being look'd upon as Suſpicious Perſons, it being not permitted to any Body to ſtay in a Garriſon without giving an Account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. After he had underſtood what Buſineſs had brought us thither, he diſpatched immediately a Meſſenger to Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You muſt know, that ſo ſoon as I had received the King's Orders to go to <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> I ſent word of it to Madam . . . . . I mean to the Lady at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret,</hi> of whom I made mention before, when I gave you an Account of my intended Voyage to <hi>Ireland.</hi> I had vanity enough to flatter my ſelf, that ſhe would not only take it as a kindneſs to hear from me, but alſo might be prevailed upon to take a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> about that time I intended to be there, becauſe ſhe had both a Brother-in law, and a Niece living near that place. For before I left <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret,</hi> ſhe told me one day, that if I ſhould happen to come back out of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſooner than I expected, and did not meet with her at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret,</hi> I might be ſure ſhe was no where elſe but at <hi>Port Lewis;</hi> meaning the <hi>Eaſt-India-Houſe</hi> there, which is about a <hi>French</hi> League diſtant from the Town, where both her Brother-in-law and Niece
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65930:131"/>
lived at that time. I knew alſo that ſhe had not ſeen them for a conſiderable time before, and that ſhe might make this a fair pretence for her Journey, which her Husband could not well deny to her, I am ſenſible that it had been my Duty to wait on her at <hi>Camaret,</hi> conſidering the great Obligations I had to her, as I told you before; but the miſchief was, that I durſt not venture at it, for fear of incurring the Diſpleaſure of the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who having given me ſo ſevere a check about my ſtaying but one day in <hi>Paris</hi> beyond his Orders, I did not think fit to run the hazard of his Diſpleaſure a ſecond time, by going ſo far out of my way; for I had all the reaſon in the World to be afraid that Monſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> who had no dependance on me, might ſend word to Court, that I neglected the King's Service to follow my pleaſure, if I ſhould be four or five days abſent from the Place whither the King's Commiſſion called me; and I could not have ſpent leſs time in this Journey, conſidering that I had twenty five Leagues of <hi>Britanny</hi> to Travel to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maret,</hi> which are equivalent to fifty <hi>French</hi> Leagues as they are about <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Mankind are apt to flatter themſelves with the hopes of what they deſire moſt; ſo it was with me; for I did not queſtion but to meet with her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore long, at the <hi>Eaſt-India-Houſe</hi> near <hi>Port Lewis.</hi> But I found my ſelf once more diſappointed in my fond hopes; for when I came thither to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her, I could not hear the leaſt Tidings of her. I made this enquiry under pretence of giving a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to Monſieur <hi>Sybret,</hi> one of the Directors of the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> who had been before to pay a Viſit to Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> at <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> they being very old Friends together. He Treated us very Magnificently, but I for my part being much Diſcompos'd in my Mind, becauſe I had been diſappointed in my Expectation of hearing ſome News of the Perſon I ſo much admired, I did not reliſh it ſo well as I ſhould have done at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; we had alſo the Honour to ſee Madam
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65930:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Sybret,</hi> who being a Native of the <hi>Indies,</hi> gave us a very Honorable reception. Here it was I had at laſt ſome ſatisfaction to underſtand that it had not been Madam . . . . . . fault that ſhe did not come to <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> her Husband having refuſed to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this Journey.</p>
               <p>This News was told me by her Niece, a Young Lady of a charming Converſation. Among other things we diſcourſed upon, I took this opportunity to give her to underſtand, that I was not altogether a Stranger to the match that was then in Agitation betwixt her, and one Monſieur <hi>de Barr;</hi> and tho' ſhe was but very young then, ſhe anſwered me with a great deal of reſervedneſs, telling me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that Subject, that ſhe was ready to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice of her Aunt. This match was Conſummated not long after, and ſhe lives very happily.</p>
               <p>I could not forbear to extoll her extraordinary behaviour before Madam <hi>Sybret,</hi> and to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the advantageous Match ſhe was likely to make; unto which Madam <hi>Sybret</hi> anſwered, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might be miſtaken in my gueſs, ſuppoſing it ſhould ſucceed, that it was her opinion, that when a young Woman Married an Old Man, ſhe was likely to meet with ſo ſlender a ſhare of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that all the Riches in the World, could ſcarce make an amends for ſuch an unhappineſs.</p>
               <p>We returned to <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> before Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard</hi> was come back from <hi>Breſt;</hi> and in the mean while were informed, of what ill Offices he had done to the Duke of <hi>Mazarin</hi> at Court.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, if he had been under my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I ſhould not have given him a very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception for being abſent from a place of ſuch Conſequence, and which was ſo much expoſed to danger at that time; beſides, that the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon conſiſted of no more, than Four Hundred Men, a great many of whom were alſo Sick; and among them all, there was ſcarce one who could
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65930:132"/>
Diſcharge a Muſquet, they being all new Levies, compoſed moſt of Boys the feweſt among them being of a fit Age to bear Arms.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we ſtay'd for Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard</hi>'s coming to Town, we were informed that one of the Captains of a Company of that Garriſon had been Caſhier'd by the Malice of the Commiſſary, with whom he had had a Quarrel; nay, that he was actually under an Arreſt, till ſuch time as he ſhould produce a certain number of Soldiers to compleat the Company, of which he had been Captain: This Captain being told of our arrival there, and that Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> and I were ſent by the King as Surveyors of the Army, he ſent one of his Friends to deſire me to do him all the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I could with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> his Friend gave me an Account, how he had been brought into this misfortune, meerly by the Malice of the Commiſſary, who had Caſhier'd ſix of his Soldiers, under pretence that they were not Old enough for Service, to take this opportunity to ſend Word to Court, that his Company had not been Compleat: That notwithſtanding this, the ſame Six Soldiers were gone over to <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> where they had Liſted themſelves under another Captain; and that the ſaid Commiſſary, when he took a review of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, had let them paſs Muſter without the leaſt Contradiction.</p>
               <p>He told me, that if I would but be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly upon the matter, it would be eaſie for me to judge, what had induced him to treat him ſo unjuſtly; he deſired me further to inform my ſelf in the matter, whilſt I was upon the ſpot, and according as I found it, to repreſent his caſe at Court, which he would look upon as a moſt infinite obligation, which he would be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>I ſent him Word, That I would do it with all my Heart, but that my advice was, he ſhould make his applications to Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65930:133"/>
he ſtanding under his immediate Command, and the thing being done there, his Teſtimony would avail him more in this caſe than mine, which perhaps might be look'd upon as partial. I told him at the ſame time that I would not have him think in the leaſt, as if I had offered this Advice, becauſe I was unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſerve him; and that to convince him on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of my good intentions, I would undertake to ſpeak my ſelf (if he thought fit) about it to Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard,</hi> to try whether I could perſwade him to join his Intereſt with mine, for his good. But his Friend Anſwered me, that they did not think it for their purpoſe to make uſe of Monſieur <hi>de Beaure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi> having ſome occaſion to fear, that he was more a Friend of the Commiſſary's than his, and that therefore he deſired me not to mention any thing of it to him, for fear if it ſhould come to the Commiſſary's Ears, he ſhould Caſheir theſe ſix Soldiers at the next Muſter, which would turn to his Friends prejudice, conſidering that the main advantage he had againſt him was, that had let the ſame Soldiers paſs Muſter in another Company whom he had Caſheir'd in his. I told him that I would follow his Directions, and do him what Service poſſibly I could.</p>
               <p>Accordingly Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> and I went ſome days after to <hi>Bell Iſle,</hi> where among others we took a review of this Company; and according to the beſt information I could get, I found that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Friend had told me nothing but what was very true; and If ound theſe 6 Soldiers very fit for Service; for though they were ſomewhat young, yet they were ſtrong body'd fellows, and ſuch as might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after paſs for choſen Men; they were alſo of a good ſeize, and in ſhort, ſuch as that I am ſure the King had above Thirty Thouſand worſe, in every reſpect, among his Troops.</p>
               <p>Being therefore fully convinced of the injuſtice done to the Captain by the Commiſſary, I drew up the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65930:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <head>THE MEMOIRS OF JOHN BAPTIST <hi>De La Fontaine,</hi> Kt. LIB. VII.</head>
               <p>SO ſoon as Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard</hi> Deputy Governour of <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> had notice of our arrival there, he returned with all imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpeed to his Government: After we had ſhew'd him our Orders, he gave us a Pilot to ſound the Coaſt, from the mouth of the River, which Exonerates it ſelf into the Sea about Two Leagues on this ſide of <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> as far as to <hi>Quim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We found five ſeveral places where an Enemy might make a deſcent, without reckoning the Bay near <hi>Quimperlei:</hi> The Entrance alſo of this River was ſo deep, that Ships of great burthen might go up a conſiderable way without danger. We ſet down in Writing, how we had found matters as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65930:134"/>
well upon the Coaſt, as alſo what was wanting on the Fortifications of <hi>Port Lewis;</hi> which, after our return to <hi>Paris,</hi> we ſent to Court to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to let him ſee that we had acquitted our ſelves as we ought to do of our Commiſſion. Whilſt we were viewing the Coaſt, Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard</hi> had received a Packet of Letters for me, from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> which he delivered to me, and among the reſt there was a Letter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to me from the <hi>French</hi> Officers I told you I left behind me in <hi>England;</hi> in which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me, that purſuant to the Orders received from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> through my hands, they had endeavoured by all poſſible means to get into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but had found all the Paſſages leading to that Kingdom, ſo narrowly guarded, that they had been forced to return to <hi>London,</hi> for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcover'd; and that they deſired me to ſend them further Inſtructions, what they were to do next; and they being deſtitute again of Money, I could put no greater an Obligation upon them, than if I would ſend them another ſupply, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to obey thoſe Orders I ſhould ſend them from Court.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> he ask'd me, what was beſt to be done in this caſe, and remembring that at the ſame time, when I gave him firſt an account of my Tranſactions in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he had ask'd me by what means I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Money, I then gave to theſe Officers, and that I had told him by my own Credit, which I had with a Banker in <hi>London;</hi> (whoſe Name I told him alſo) he Commanded me to Write to the ſaid Banker, and to Order him, upon ſight of my Letter, to pay the Summ of Four Thouſand One Hundred Livers to the Sieur <hi>du Meſnil,</hi> the ſame Officer who was firſt ſent to me by the others, and had introduced them into my acquaintance; he ordered me alſo, to Write a Letter at the ſame time to Monſieur <hi>du Meſnil,</hi> that immediately
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65930:135"/>
after the receipt of this Money, he ſhould divide it ſhare and ſhare a like among all theſe Officers, (he being to be comprehended in their number) and that they ſhould all take the firſt opportunity to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they ſhould addreſs themſelves to one <hi>Jalet,</hi> Steward to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> by whom they might be inform'd, where I was, and where they might hear of me.</p>
               <p>Theſe Four Thouſand One Hundred Livers, were to be divided equally betwixt Forty One Officers, at the rate of One Hundred Livers a piece; for though there were Forty Three in all, yet the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> had thought fit to except Two of them, to whom the King would not extend his Gracious Pardon, their Crime being of ſo high a Nature, as not to be left unpuniſh'd, I charged him to be very punctual in obſerving my Directions, that I might not hereafter meet with Reproaches inſtead of Thanks, for having interceeded in their behalf.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, That thoſe two Officers, who were excluded from being partakers of the Kings mercy, had made themſelves very notorious; their miſdemeanour having made a great Noiſe not only in <hi>Paris,</hi> but all over the Kingdom, ſome Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For they had had the boldneſs to break one of the chains of <hi>Paris,</hi> to reſcue one of their Brothers, who being faſtened with it, fled with the other two to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> Commanded me at the ſame time, to Write two Letters more, to the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . . . and my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . . to give them to underſtand, that I had found the Fortifications of <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> in the ſame condition, as had been repreſented to them, whilſt I was in <hi>England;</hi> and that a deſcent might eaſily be made thereabouts, which queſtionleſs would make them maſters of that Port, and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe near it: That I was juſt ready to go into <hi>Poictou,</hi> where I did not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65930:135"/>
queſtion but to meet with at leaſt as much En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as here, of which they ſhould be ſure to receive ſpeedy Intelligence as ſoon as I was able to give them a true Account of the matter.</p>
               <p>Afterwards Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> and I, were again ordered by the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> to return to <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> to take a Review there of ſome new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Troops, which were lately ſent thither, and to take alſo another View of the Fortifications there, in order to give him a more particular Account of them than we had done before.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, after we had done our Buſineſs at <hi>Port Lewis,</hi> we Travelled along the Coaſt about eight <hi>French</hi> Leagues below the Port, from whence it is not above four <hi>French</hi> Leagues over to that Iſland; we got there a Chalop, which carried us firſt to the Latitude of the two little Iſlands called the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.</hi> Theſe two Iſlands (if they may deſerve that name) are of a very ſlender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compaſs, about half a League diſtant from one another; they are ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all ſides with very high Rocks, who may be diſcovered at a conſiderable diſtance at Sea; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Purple colour, they have given the name of <hi>Cardinals</hi> to theſe Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Two Privateers, the one a <hi>Dutch-man</hi> from <hi>Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the other a <hi>French-man</hi> from St. <hi>Maloes,</hi> had ſheltered themſelves among theſe Rocks unknown to one another, in hopes of meeting with ſome Prize or other, this being a great Road for Ships, and where they may be ſoon ſurprized by Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who come out upon them unawares from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Rocks.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fluſhing</hi> Privateer no ſooner diſcry'd our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and ſuppoſing by our fine Scarlet Cloaks, that there were ſome Paſſengers of Quality in it, he made the beſt of his way towards us. But whilſt he was Chaſing his Prize, which he looked upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as good as his own, conſidering the little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance we were able to make, out ſtarts the St. <hi>Malo</hi> Privateer from among the Rocks, which made
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65930:136"/>
him think it high time to look to himſelf inſtead of Attacking us. They were both near equal in ſtrength, and if we could have foreſeen which of them would have the better, we might have ſtaid where we were, to be Spectators of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but for fear Fortune ſhould declare againſt our ſide, we reſolved to change our Courſe, and to make the beſt of our way towards the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, becauſe we found that the Wind was more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to carry us thither than to <hi>Bell-Iſle.</hi> Beſides, Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> had a Relapſe of the ſame fearful Fit that ſeized him before in the Inn; and to confeſs the truth, I my ſelf was not very fond of running the hazard to fall once more into the Enemies hands.</p>
               <p>In the mean while theſe two Privateers began to exchange their Broad-ſides very briskly, but the St. <hi>Malo</hi> Privateer, who was much better Mann'd than the <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> finding that if he could Board him, he ſhould fight him with a double Advantage, did all what he could to lay cloſe on Board him, which he at laſt effected in ſpite of all the endeavours of his Enemy to the contrary. After they came to a cloſe Engagement, the St. <hi>Malo</hi> Privateer ſoon got the better of the other, and in leſs than an Hour, made himſelf Maſter of the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>We could ſee exactly the whole Engagement, though we were at a conſiderable diſtance, which made us once more change our Courſe, and Steer for the Coaſt of <hi>Bell-Iſle,</hi> whither we were bound. After we had executed our Orders there, we went to <hi>Rochel,</hi> where we were likewiſe to view the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, we there received new Inſtructions to diſcharge the Militia which was in Garriſon there; which being done accordingly, we continued our Journey into <hi>Poictou,</hi> in order to viſit the Proteſtant Gentry of that Province.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de</hi> . . . . . a Gentleman of Quality, and of a conſiderable Eſtate, being one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, who was look'd upon by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65930:136"/>
as one of their Party, I had his Name among the reſt in my <hi>Memorandum:</hi> We went to pay him a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, but it juſt happened that his Lady lay dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ill, almoſt paſt all hopes of recovery; ſo that we were diſappointed in our expectation of ſeeing him in Perſon: for he ſent us word by one of his Servants, that his Houſe was at our Service, but that he hoped we would excuſe him, if at this time, when he was quite overwhelm'd with Grief, he was not in a condition to keep us company, and to entertain us in the ſame manner as he ſhould have been ready to do at another time. This made us take a Reſolution not to tarry in the Houſe at ſuch an unſeaſonable Juncture. From thence we went to another Gentleman's Houſe, whoſe name being Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur . . . . . . was look'd upon as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Zealots in the whole Province for his Religion. After we had diſcourſed with him for ſometime, we were fully convinced he was ſo great a Biggot, that had it been in his power, he would have been one of the moſt forward in re-eſtabliſhing his Religion in ſpite of the King's Edict to the contrary. I ſhew'd him my Commiſſion (which I own was beyond what I deſerv'd) and he looking upon it as a pledge of my Integrity, introduced me to ſeveral other Gentlemen of the Country that were his Friends, and of the ſame Religion.</p>
               <p>I ſoon perceived that they were all agreed in the main point of their Opinions; but all that I could get out of them, was, that they were not in a Condition to undertake any thing of moment by themſelves; but all they could do, was to offer their Vows and Prayers for the Succeſs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s, (King <hi>William</hi> III.) Arms.</p>
               <p>We were fully convinc'd by this, that there was no ſet Party againſt the Government, in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as the two <hi>French</hi> Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> had endeavoured to perſwade us; though at the ſame time it was eaſie to be ſeen, that it was rather for want of power, than for want of good will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:65930:137"/>Monſieur <hi>de</hi> . . . . . . and ſeveral others, all Gentlemen of very good Quality in that Province, ſpoke altogether to the ſame purpoſe, as the reſt had done; of which I gave an exact Account to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who ſent me word, that after I had viſited in the ſame manner ſome other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Houſes thereabouts, I might expect his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtructions at my own Seat, becauſe I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave to Divert my ſelf there for ſome days. But as they agreed all in the ſame Opinion, ſo their Diſcourſe was altogether to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and with all the Art I had, I could not get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more out of them, but what I had heard the other ſay before. But to be plain in the matter, I began to relent extreamly at the preſent unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Circumſtances of my Affairs, which put me under a neceſſity of acting a part ſo little ſuitable to my Inclination, which I have repreſented to you here without diſguiſe, in its natural Shape.</p>
               <p>I could not but conſider with my ſelf unto what Danger I expoſed theſe Gentlemen, who, though they were not actually engaged in any Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State; yet had told me enough to forfeit their Lives, if the Court ſhould take any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt them. I began to reflect ſeriouſly, that by this Action I muſt incur the hatred of ſo many Gentlemen of Quality, if one time or other, they ſhould get the leaſt notice that under pretence of Viſiting them, I was come to Trapan them at their own Houſes. I was ſo far overtaken with theſe Conſiderations, that I could not forbear to ſay ſomething of it to Monſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> which I believe did me no great kindneſs afterwards.</p>
               <p>After we had taken our round among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Gentry, we came at laſt to my own Houſe, where I entertain'd Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> as well as poſſibly I could; and he on the other hand, ſhew'd a great deal of Friendſhip for me, and as a mark of his kind Inclinations to me and my Family, would needs be Godfather to one of my Children, who was then
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65930:137"/>
to be Baptized. But it is a very difficult Task to ſearch the bottom of the Heart of Mankind, and nothing is more frequent in this World than to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake thoſe for our Friends, who are ſometimes the worſt of our Enemies; ſo it happen'd betwixt us; for he did not only deal very unkindly with me, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew anon, but I had all the reaſon to believe that he was ſent along with me on purpoſe to be a Spy over all my Tranſactions. Nay, I ſhrewdly ſuſpected, that he had done me ſome ill Offices before I left <hi>Paris;</hi> and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, had it not been for that, I had been ſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to the Sea-Coaſt, and into <hi>Poictou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however it be, one day whilſt he was at my Houſe, a certain young Man came to ſee him, and Talk'd with him in private. I remembring to have ſeen the young Fellow, ask'd him who he was. He anſwered me, that he had formerly belong'd to the Intendant of the Princeſs of <hi>Conti,</hi> the King's Daughter, and that they having liv'd and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a familiar Acquaintance together in the ſame Houſe, he was come to pay him a Viſit as he paſs'd by this way, being told that he was at my Houſe; we happened juſt then to be at <hi>Montreville,</hi> where this young Gentleman's Brother was one of the Receivers of the King's Taxes; which induced me the more to rely upon Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s word, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any further enquiry into the matter, as indeed, I found afterwards, I ought to have done; for I might eaſily have Conjectured, that if he told me the truth, he needed not have taken ſo much pains to talk with him in private, and to uſe ſo much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for fear of being over-heard.</p>
               <p>The next Morning he told me that he would go to <hi>Samur,</hi> to ſee whether we had any News there from Court. He had no ſooner left me, but it came into my Head, that there was ſomething more than ordinary in this Journey. I conſidered with my ſelf, whether I had beſt to ſend one of my Servants after him; but fearing leſt he might be diſcovered by
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65930:138"/>
him, or that the Fellow might not have wit enough to manage the matter as he ought to do, and that conſequently I might have a wrong account of what I wanted, to know, I reſolved to expect his return, and to ſift his Servant, who was but indifferently ſatisfied with his Maſter. I pitched alſo upon another Expedient, which was to employ my <hi>Valet de Chamber</hi> in the Buſineſs, who I knew, might pump Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s Servant, without my appearing in it. Purſuant to this reſolution, I inſtructed my <hi>Valet</hi> how to behave himſelf in the matter; and no ſooner was Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> returned from <hi>Samur,</hi> but he got his Servant to the Tavern, where after they had drunk a Bottle or two, they began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s laſt Journey to <hi>Samur;</hi> my <hi>Valet</hi> by degrees ask'd him, what Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he might have there, where he Lodged, and how long he ſtaid there. His Servant without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the matter, told him, That as ſoon as they came to <hi>Samur,</hi> they alighted at the <hi>Horn-Inn,</hi> where his Maſter met another Gentleman, who Dined with him; they Diſcourſed much about me, and that he was ſure the other was none of my Friend, becauſe he had told ſuch things of me, as I would not very well reliſh if I ſhould hear of it. My Servant finding him ſo forward, and willing to improve it to further his Deſign, anſwered, That he did not wonder at it, for I was a Man of a ſtrange Temper, and, who had behaved my ſelf ſo, as ſcarce to have one Friend left in the whole Province; that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to ſtay with me much longer, but as ſoon as he could meet with a better Maſter would bid me farewel.</p>
               <p>They then ſet the Glaſs about, which together with what he had heard my Servant ſay, made the other as open hearted as could be deſired. For <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s Servant, after he had drunk two or three Bumpers more, was ſo free as to tell mine, that he did not wonder I lived in ſo fine a Seat, for if he had the ſame Opportunity of Purloining two hundred
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65930:138"/>
thouſand Livres in <hi>Holland,</hi> he would live in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this.</p>
               <p>My Servant reply'd, that this was not the firſt time he had heard ſomething like this, but the thing being only whiſpered about, he could never get to the bottom of it, and that therefore he deſired him to give him a Circumſtantial Account of what he had heard. The other then told him that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and his Maſter had talk'd of nothing elſe all Dinner-time; and that he had alſo ſaid ſomething of Pearls and Jewels, which I had got the ſame way; but that, being not near enough to underſtand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Word that paſſed betwixt them, he could not be poſitive whether theſe Jewels were comprehended in theſe 200000 Livres, or not; but thus much he had heard them declare poſitively, that 10000 Livres had been offered as a Reward to any Body who ſhould diſcover any of theſe Goods. My Servant continued to act the part of a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ſo lively, that the other believing him to be real, did not refuſe to anſwer him to any queſtion he ask'd, as imagining that it was very welcome News to him. Upon which, my Servant further ask'd him, what kind of a Perſon he was that ſpoke theſe words; of whom he gave him the beſt Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he could, and told him that Monſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> his Maſter had accoſted the other as if they had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old Acquaintance, and that they parted from one another with all the expreſſions of a mutual kindneſs.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that when I underſtood how Matters had been carried on by <hi>de Vaux</hi> againſt me, I could ſcarce contain my ſelf within the bounds of Moderation; for what could be more baſe, than to treat thus a Friend from whom he had received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Obligations; and it was evident to me beyond all contradiction, that their meeting at <hi>Samur</hi> had been appointed on purpoſe, and that the young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whom I ſaw in my Houſe, and talk'd with him in private, had been ſent to make the ſaid Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which could not but be very ſurprizing to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65930:139"/>
me, conſidering I never had given him the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deal thus treacherouſly with me, but on the contrary, had been ready to oblige him in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways.</p>
               <p>I was not a little puzzled how to find out the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Servant had deſcribed to mine; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his deſcription, there were two ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who being both mine Enemies, did both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſo near to it, that indeed I ſhrewdly gueſſed it muſt be one of the two, but could not tell upon which of them to fix, for fear I might be miſtaken in my gueſs. One of them I have had occaſion to mention before, to wit, the Councellor <hi>des Iſles,</hi> and as for the other, I think I need not be very ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous to name him, it being ſufficiently known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Neighbourhood in the Country, that we have been at variance together for ſome time paſt, which makes me believe, that with a ſafe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I might well miſtruſt him, that upon an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he would not ſtick to do me an Injury: His Name was <hi>Ternai,</hi> which he had borrow'd from his Eſtate, which lay about half a <hi>French</hi> League from my Seat, the true Name of his Family being <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi> He was a Nephew of the Prior of <hi>Ternai,</hi> whom I have mentioned before. His Great Grand-Father had been Steward of the Duke of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> one of the Anceſtors of the Duke of <hi>Tremoville</hi> now living.</p>
               <p>So much for his Extraction, which bearing but a ſlender proportion with the Title of a Marqueſs, which he has taken up of late; this proved the firſt occaſion of our Quarrel, becauſe I uſed now and then to laugh at it, and ſo did almoſt all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that Province, as well as I. But that which I believe made him bear a particular grudge to me, was, That I diſcovered in ſome of the Deeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to my Eſtate, that he was only ſtiled Monſieur <hi>d'Arſac,</hi> Lord of the Manner of <hi>Faie,</hi> without as much as giving him the Title of Eſquire. His Eſtate call'd <hi>Ternai,</hi> may be worth about One
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65930:139"/>
Hundred and Fifty Pounds Sterling <hi>per Annum,</hi> at the moſt, and was purchaſed by this pretended Marqueſs his Grand-Father, for Fourteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers; yet ſo, that he did not pay one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ready Money for it; this being given him as an Equivalent for the Death of his Father; who, as I told you before, was Steward to one of the Anceſtors of the preſent Duke of <hi>Tremoville.</hi> He was Murdered by ſome of the Marqueſs <hi>de Beauveau</hi> his Servants, and it being proved that the fact had been committed upon their Maſters Command; and the Duke of <hi>Tremoville</hi> ſiding with the Heirs of his Domeſtick, and backing their cauſe by his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the ſaid Marqueſs <hi>de Beauveau</hi> was by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a Judgment obtained againſt him, to pay the ſaid Summ for Damages, Coſts, and Intereſt, which he being either unwilling or unable to do, the Heirs of the Deceaſed got into poſſeſſion of this Eſtate.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the Father of this Marqueſs <hi>de Ternai</hi> was a Captain of Horſe, and married Madamoiſelle <hi>de Palluau,</hi> Siſter to the Count <hi>de Palluau,</hi> Major General of the Light-Horſe, and who afterwards was Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> under the name of <hi>Cleram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut;</hi> whether this gives him any Title to what his Son pretends to be, to wit, Marqueſs of <hi>Ternai,</hi> I am not able to tell.</p>
               <p>But however it may be, the Marqueſs and I liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very Friendly together, for ſome time after I had bought my Seat, and we uſed frequently to meet like good Neighbours, and as honeſt Gentlemen do in the Country; till Intereſt, which divides all the World, ſet us at variance, when I did not in the leaſt expect it; for he brought an Action againſt me under pretence that ſome part of my Eſtate was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on his; but the Duke <hi>de Tremoville</hi> ſiding with me, took up the Cudgels, and entred an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Ternai</hi> fearing, not without reaſon, that his Sword would ſcarce be long enough to meaſure it with the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65930:140"/>
Duke's, thought it beſt to let the buſineſs drop for that time.</p>
               <p>But it was not long before he gave me a new cauſe of Diſpleaſure; for which I was fain to call him to an Account at Law. For he would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fiſh in my River, but even in the very Ponds and Ditches belonging to my Houſe, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he did meerly out of ſpite, becauſe I refuſed to lend him ſome Money, of which he ſtood much in need at that time, to carry on a Law Suit againſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Clerambaut,</hi> about an Inheritance of the Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> who had diſinherited him.</p>
               <p>When I ſeriouſly reflected that I had no other Enemies but this Marqueſs and the Councellor <hi>des Iſles,</hi> in the whole Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> I could not but fix the Matter upon one of theſe two; and it was not long before I had ſufficient reaſon to lay it altogether at the Door of the Marqueſs <hi>de Ternai;</hi> for happening one day to ſpeak of him before Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Vaux,</hi> he unawares let ſlip ſome Words, which gave me the firſt hint of him; for he told me, that I had but a bad Neighbour of him; that he was none of my Friend, and that he believed if it ſhould fall in his way to do me an ill turn, he would not fail to do it. I reply'd coldly, that I was well enough ſatisfied of it, and ſo turned our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe another way, for fear of ſaying any thing that might give him an intimation that I was not ignorant of what had lately paſs'd betwixt them at <hi>Samur;</hi> which might perhaps have raiſed my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that pitch as to have proved the occaſion of a fatal Quarrel; whereas it has always been with me a Fundamental Principle which ought to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved by every Body, not to violate the Law of Hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>From what I have told you, it is no difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to judge, that theſe malicious Inſinuations of the Marqueſs <hi>de Ternai</hi> had chiefly their Off ſpring from what I told you before, concerning my Spouſe's Mother-in-law, who had ſet ſome at work to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65930:140"/>
make an enquiry after my Affairs at <hi>Loudun;</hi> but of all the reſt, nothing went ſo near me as Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s odd behaviour, which was ſuch, as to be paſt all Excuſe. But if he gave me ſufficient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Complaint at this time, he furniſhed me with another not long after, as I ſhall relate to you anon, when I ſhall give you an Account of what happened to me after our return to <hi>Paris,</hi> purſuant to the Orders ſent us for that purpoſe by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly, we left my Houſe in the Country, and Travelled to <hi>Tours,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> took a place in the Stage-Coach, becauſe he was troubled with the Stone in his Kidneys, ſo as not to be able to Travel on Horſe-back. At another time I ſhould have had ſo much Complaiſance, as not to let him go alone, but to have born him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany my ſelf in the Coach; but as Diſſembling is not my Talent, I was glad to take this Opprotuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Fore-lock, to part from him; my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe was, that a Stage-Coach was as troubleſome to me, as a Horſe could be to him. Thus we took our leave of one another, till our next meeting at <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe I being on Horſe-baek, was likely to Travel much faſter than the Coach could do. I laid that Night at <hi>Blois,</hi> and the next at <hi>Orleans.</hi> The next following day, early in the morning I ſet forward from <hi>Orleans,</hi> in Company of another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whom I had met accidentally in the Inn where I Lodged; and we were forced to Travel without any Attendance, becauſe we had left my Servant, who was fallen ill, behind us. As we were Travelling in a Foreſt, which is about two <hi>French</hi> Leagues on this ſide of <hi>Orleans,</hi> we perceived two Fellows with their Fuſees to come out of the Wood, as if they intended to croſs the Road at ſome little diſtance before us. They pretended to be Hunters, and to confirm us in this belief, ask'd us whether we had not ſeen the Hounds paſs by that way; but I did not like their looks, which made me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to turn my Horſe out of the Road, but
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65930:141"/>
ſeveral heaps of Paving Stone lying in my way on both ſides, my Horſe was in danger of ſtumbling, and whilſt I put the Spurs to his ſide to make him go on the bolder, two more Fellows ſtarted behind us out of the Wood. At the ſame time, thoſe two that were before us, perceiving what my Intention was, cry'd out to me, <hi>Stand, or you are a dead Man.</hi> I had not ſeen the other that were behind us, which made me prepare my ſelf for a vigorous defence, thinking it a ſhame for us to be Robbed by two Rogues; ſo with my Piſtol in hand I was advancing toward them, but as I clapped Spurs to my Horſe, he happened to ſlip upon theſe Stones, ſo that I fell under him; one of theſe Rogues ſeeing me in this Poſture, let fly at me, but by good Fortune miſſed me, giving only a ſlight Wound to my Horſe in the Breaſt, becauſe the Ball happened to hit upon a little Braſs Plate which was upon the Harneſs, which ſtifled the force of the Ball. Whilſt I was endeavouring to get from under my Horſe, the Foot-pads laid hold on me, and Diſarmed me without any great trouble, becauſe my Fellow Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller did not make the leaſt-Reſiſtance; they ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me all-over, and took all my Money, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion run the ſame Fortune; whilſt they were ſearching me, I happened to know one of them, who lived not above two <hi>French</hi> Leagues from my Houſe in the Country; as far as I could gueſs, he did not know me at firſt, but a little after he put his Handkerchief in his Mouth, which made me imagin that he began to remember who I was, and did this not to be diſcovered by me.</p>
               <p>The other three Rogues were of the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they ſaw him do thus, which made them ask him, whether he knew one of us two? This Queſtion was like a Thunder-clap to me, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that our Lives depended abſolutely on his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it being beyond all queſtion, that they would have killed us, to ſecure themſelves from being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd. When we ſaw our ſelves in this diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, expecting every moment nothing leſs than
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65930:141"/>
preſent Death from the hands of theſe deſperate Rogues, God Almighty ſent us a ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Relief, by which we were delivered from that imminent danger that threatned our immediate Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Six <hi>Sweediſh</hi> Gentlemen, who were Travelling on Horſe-back to <hi>Orleans,</hi> appeared all on a ſudden at ſome diſtance from us, upon the ſame Road; but perceiving what they were going to do with us, they clapped the Spurs to their Horſes, and came up towards us in a full gallop; the Foot-pads no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perceived them, but truſting more to their Heels than their Fuſees, ſoon left us to ſave their own lives. Whilſt they were making the beſt of their way into the Woods, one of theſe Foreign Gentlemen diſcharged his Piſtol at one of the Rogues, and wounded him. Notwithſtanding which, he got into the Wood, but the Blood that iſſued from his Wound being a certain mark for us to purſue him, we followed the track for ſome time, till we loſt it, and with it the hopes of taking him. Thus we all reſolved to purſue our Journey, and after my fellow Sufferer and I had given a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Thanks to our Deliverers, who had ſnatched us out of the very Jaws of Death, we purſued our Journey, and they continued theirs to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where they talk'd of this Adventure to ſeveral they met with.</p>
               <p>The ſame Rogue who had been Wounded by one of theſe Gentlemen, had abſconded himſelf in one of the neighbouring Villages, from whence he ſent to <hi>Orleans</hi> for a Chirurgeon to dreſs his Wounds. As Ill fortune would have it theſe Strangers happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to the ſame Chirurgeon to be Shaved, to whom they told their Adventure upon the Road, and how they had ſhot one of theſe four Thieves. The Chirurgeon ſoon ſuſpecting, that perhaps he who had ſent for him, might be the ſame Perſon that had been Wounded by one of theſe Gentlemen, gave notice of it to a Juſtice of Peace, who ſent ſome Myrmidons abroad to ſeize him. They followed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65930:142"/>
the Chirurgeon at ſome diſtance, till they ſaw him enter the Houſe, when they came in not long after and took the Rogue, whilſt the Chirurgeon was dreſſing his Wound. They went alſo in purſuit of the reſt, but he who was taken refuſing to make the leaſt diſcovery of them, they eſcaped for that time; it being very probable, that when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what was become of their Companion, they left that part of the Country, and exerciſed their Trade in ſome more remote parts of <hi>France.</hi> He who know me at that time, had however the Impudence to come to his own home ſome time after, but did not think fit to tarry there long, for fear, as I ſuppoſe, I ſhould take him up, which I ſhould not have foreborn, in Order to have him puniſhed according to his deſerts.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I was but under very ill cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, neither my fellow Traveller nor I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any money left us; but by good chance, theſe Rogues had not found out my Watch, which I ſent to pawn, rather than to ſtay for Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s coming, who would elſe have furniſh'd me with what I wanted; ſo I got at laſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I gave an account to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> of the ſucceſs of our Journey. He Commanded me at the ſame time not to wait on him for the future, any where elſe but at <hi>Mendon,</hi> where I was with him at that time, for fear that ſome of the Enemy's Spies might know me, and take notice of the frequent Audiences I had of him. Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> coming ſome days after me to <hi>Paris,</hi> waited alſo on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to whom he likewiſe a Relation how we had found matters in thoſe places, we were ſent to viſit; but could not forbear to rehearſe ſome of thoſe paſſages he had heard at <hi>Samur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> gave me a hint of it the firſt time I ſaw him; for he ask'd me whether there had been any conteſt betwixt us two, in our laſt Journey, and whether I believed him to be my Friend? I reply'd that for my part, I had been very obliging to him in all reſpects; but that he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65930:142"/>
had made me but a ſlender return, becauſe as I was credibly inform'd, he had taken a Journey to <hi>Samur,</hi> on purpoſe to meet a certain perſon, whom he knew to be my Enemy, and with whom he had ſcarce any acquaintance before; I told him further, that, as I could not attribute this forwardneſs of his to any thing elſe, but to his eagerneſs of hearkning to the inſinuations of my Enemies, ſo I had ever ſince made great account of his Friendſhip, tho' at the ſame time I had been very careful in hiding my juſt reſentment againſt him, becauſe I was willing to Sacrifice my own paſſion to his Majeſty's Service, and the Laws of Hoſpitality, which muſt have been impaired, if I ſhould have gone about to let him feel the effects of my juſt reſentment. I took this opportunity to give him a ſuccinct, but true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the whole matter, which had prov'd the occaſion of thoſe various reports raiſed againſt me; as imagining that by diſcovering the whole truth to this Miniſter, I might in a great meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ill conſequences, which Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s diſcourſes would have brought upon me, if they had made a real impreſſion upon his mind.</p>
               <p>I took alſo the Liberty to put him in mind upon this occaſion, what I had Writ to him before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Knaviſh Councellor <hi>Des Iſles,</hi> who was a continual Plague to me. He told me that he would Write again about him to the Intendant of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers,</hi> to ſearch into the bottom of this buſineſs; and he did not fail of his promiſe in that point, for not long after, the ſaid Intendant, who had hitherto, and would willingly for the future have ſheltred him under his Protection, was obliged to ſend him to Priſon.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> himſelf was the perſon, who ſent me word of it, in ſome days after, and at the ſame time Commanded me to Write again into <hi>England,</hi> but in a far different ſtile, from what I had Writ before, purſuant to his Orders. For whereas in my laſt Letters ſent into <hi>England,</hi> I had given them an Account, that in all places where I
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65930:143"/>
had been, I had found every thing diſpoſed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the deſign and ſucceſs of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (K. <hi>William</hi> III.) I was now to alter my tune, and to tell them, that what had been reported to them concerning the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> were nothing but empty Fancies, and imaginary Notions; that I was not a little afraid I had laid my ſelf too open before ſome Gentlemen of that Province, who, tho' they had the reputation of being great well wiſhers to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet had always ſhew'd ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs in any Conpany, that I could not give the leaſt aſſurance of their good Inclinations to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court. I was ordered further to let them underſtand, That the Gentlemen of the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> were ſo far from entring into a Cabal in favour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were altogether jealous of one another; and that the true reaſon of this miſtruſtfulneſs, did not proceed from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had been induſtriouſly ſpread among them; That the <hi>French</hi> Court had brought over ſome of their own party, to their Intereſt, by the force of that moſt irreſiſtible Charm, Gold; who being to act as Spies, and to found their inclinations, this had had the deſired effect to ſow the Seeds of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy among them, no body knowing whom to truſt, or not: And that therefore, if they perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their reſolution to make a deſcent upon <hi>France;</hi> the wiſeſt courſe they could take, would be, to bring along with them ſuch a Force, as would be ſufficient to maintain their Ground, without the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary aſſiſtance of theſe Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters which were dictated to me by the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> (as all the reſt had been before) being ſealed up in my preſence with the ſame Seal I always made uſe of, when I Writ into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> he ordered me to return forth with to <hi>Paris,</hi> and for the future not to come to <hi>Mendon,</hi> unleſs I was ſent for. What moſt ſurprized me, was, that he did not mention the leaſt Syllable of thoſe Four Thouſand One Hundred Livers, which according to his Commands, I had Ordered my Banker at
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65930:143"/>
                  <hi>London</hi> to pay theſe <hi>French</hi> indigent Officers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I knew he had had a Letter of advice from the ſaid Banker, that they had been paid according to Directions; for tho' the Bankers Letter was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to me, the Poſt-Maſter had been ſo Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to Deliver it into this Miniſters own hands: But the worſt of all was, that theſe Officers, purſuant to thoſe Orders received from Court by my hands, did come not long after to <hi>Paris,</hi> where having made their applications to Monſieur <hi>Jalet,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Steward, (purſuant to my own Direction) he ſent them to me.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw my ſelf Surrounded with ſo many Gentlemen, who all rely'd upon my aſſiſtance, I was under the greateſt irreſolution that could be, what courſe beſt to take; conſidering the ſtrict Orders I had received from this Miniſter not to appear at Court at <hi>Mendon.</hi> The only means I had left, was to put Pen to Paper, and to give an account of it to him, who ſent me word, that I ſhould come along with them the next day, to his Country Seat, at nine a Clock in the Forenoon. Accordingly we made our appearance the next day at the appointed hour and place; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> took the pains to talk with every one in particular, and he ask'd each of them, in what ſtation he had been before he left <hi>France,</hi> what had been the occaſion of his flight, and in what Quality he had ſerved in the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Troops; after which he Ordered them to follow what inſtructions they ſhould receive from me.</p>
               <p>He took me aſide at the ſame time, and told me that I muſt take care to ſee them Lodged in ſome Inns near to my Lodgings, and to agree with the Inn-keepers for their Subſiſtence as cheap as could be done; adding, that it would be for a little time only, to wit, till he ſhould have time to conſider what was further to be done with them. I reply'd, that my Purſe was not in a condition at this time, to bear the Charges of ſo many Gentlemen; unto
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65930:144"/>
which he anſwered, that he would take care of them in a very little time, and that I ſhould not be long troubled with them.</p>
               <p>But whilſt theſe Officers were diſpoſed in theſe Inns, my Banker in <hi>London</hi> drew a Bill of Exchange upon me, of four thouſand one hundred Livres, which he had paid to them by my Order, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I gave immediate notice of it to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and deſired him to enable me to diſcharge this Debt, which he promiſed me to do forthwith; but the time of the Payment being juſt expiring, without hearing any thing further from this Miniſter, I was put to a great Nonplus. He happened juſt then to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo that I took this opportunity to wait on him there, and to put him in mind of the Bill of Exchange, which was payable within two days after. He gave me for Anſwer, that he had forgot to perfom what he had promiſed me, but that he was going to <hi>Verſailles</hi> the next day, and immediately after his return from thence, would take effectual care of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Sum. But either he did forget it again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe he had no mind to think of it, (the laſt of which ſeems moſt probable to me) for the day of payment came, and I had not one Shilling from him to pay the Bill.</p>
               <p>This diſappointment was followed by another; for if this Miniſter had failed in his promiſe concerning the payment of the Money, he was as careleſs in performing it, in relation to thoſe <hi>French</hi> Officers, which he had promiſed to take off of my Hands in a ſhort time, and were not in a capacity to ſubſiſt without my Aſſiſtance. I had no Sur-plus of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſupply their wants, and the Inn-keeper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where they Lodged, began to be very backward to take my Word any further than they had done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, conſidering that I had no ſettled Habitation either in or near the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> This made m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrain my Credit with my Land-lady, who being an old rich Maid, I prevailed with her ſo far, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her Word both for them and me to the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:65930:144"/>Thus they were pretty quiet for ſome time, but Monſieur <hi>de Ville,</hi> a Banker of <hi>Paris,</hi> unto whom I was to pay the Bill of Exchange, having Proteſted for want of due payment, the ſaid Bill; I carried a Copy of it, together with two Letters, lately ſent me from <hi>England,</hi> to the ſaid Marqueſs <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois.</hi> Theſe two Letters being brought to me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the Poſt-houſe, without being firſt ſent to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> (as they always uſed to be done before) I began to ſuſpect that this was intended for a Trap to catch me in, to wit, to try whether I would either be ſo ill adviſed, as to open them without him, or perhaps keep them by me without communicating them to him. For beſides that, I began to be jealous of the Effects of thoſe malicious Suggeſtions, which Monſieur <hi>de Vaux</hi> had inſinuated into this Miniſter, I had great reaſon to believe, that at this time more than ever, he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a reſolution to Sacrifice me for the publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, conſidering, (as I told you before) that he judged it more adviſeable, to let me fall as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the State, than to puniſh a great many of the Proteſtants, whom he knew to be ill affected to the preſent Government in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whether I were miſtaken in my gueſs or not, I was reſolved not to give him the leaſt occaſion of this nature, and ſo carried thoſe Letters to him, Sealed up as they were delivered to me from the Poſt-houſe. After he had peruſed them, he gave them to me, and told me that it was time now to put a ſtop to our further Correſpondence with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that I ſhould not write any more, either to the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . or my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . who had ſent me theſe in anſwer to my laſt Letters I writ by this Miniſter's direction. They contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſubſtance, That they were not a little ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Advice I had given them in my laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were aſſured from very good hands, and ſuch as were beyond all queſtion, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in the Province of <hi>Poictou,</hi> were ready to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard every thing for the recovery of the liberty of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65930:145"/>
their Conſciences, and to free themſelves from that Bondage they groan'd under at this time; that therefore they would have me not be diſcouraged, or miſ-led by theſe ill grounded Suppoſitions which were the only obſtacle that could in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, prove prejudicial to ſo great and well laid a Deſign.</p>
               <p>My Lord L . . . . . ſent me alſo Word about the Paſs I had deſired of him, for the Importation of ſome Wines, and told me, that he could not but wonder I had not mentioned any thing of it ſince, deſiring me at the ſame time, to let him know where the fault lay, being well aſſured on their ſide, that every Body was very ready to gratifie me in this, as well as in any other matter which might tend to my Advantage.</p>
               <p>As to what I had demonſtrated to him concerning the proteſt of my Bill, and the trouble I was in about theſe <hi>French</hi> indigent Officers, I could get no other ſatisfaction but what he had given me ſeveral times before, to wit, That he had forgot it, but would take care of it without any further delay. If I had not been beyond my right Wits, and made ſerious Reflections upon a matter of ſuch Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to me, as I ought to have done, I might without conſulting the Stars, have dived into the bottom of the whole buſineſs, or at leaſt have given a ſhrewd gueſs at his deſign, and its true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. But it ſeems it is a natural defect in Mankind, not to make uſe of the ſame foreſight in our own Affairs, as we do in others, which made me not to be in the leaſt aware of the Snare that was intended for me, till I was catch'd in it, paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating.</p>
               <p>This made me be ſo careleſs, as freely to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that it was that great weight and multiplicity of buſineſs, which continually Harraſs'd this Miniſters thoughts, which had made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of mine; in hopes of which I returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> living in expectation of the iſſue of his fair promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:65930:145"/>In the mean while Mr. <hi>de Ville,</hi> who I told you had proteſted the Bill of Exchange, had given an Account of it to my Banker in <hi>London,</hi> who had ſent him word, to talk with me again concerning the Payment of it, and that in caſe I were not as yet in a Capacity to ſatisfie the Contents of it, to propoſe this as an expedient to me; that if my Spouſe would accept the ſaid Bill, he would be willing to give me further time for the payment of it. My old Land-lady, who had got ſome ſcent of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and who began alſo to be tired, to be fed with nothing but bare promiſes, began alſo to think it time to look about her, and therefore reſolved to make uſe of the ſame Expedient the Banker had done. But being not willing at that time to fall out with me herſelf, ſhe ſet the Inn-keepers, where thoſe Officers lodged, at work, who made me the ſame Propoſition. I muſt confeſs I could not blame them for what they did, it having been always a conſtant principle with me, to pay every body what I owed him, to the utmoſt of my power, and living beſides that, in full expectation to ſee in a few days the Effects of the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi>'s Promiſes, I deſired my Spouſe to engage her Word for their further Security, which ſhe willingly did.</p>
               <p>There happened in the mean while ſeveral other Diſturbances amongſt theſe Officers, which put me to no ſmall vexation and trouble. Among the reſt, one of thoſe Officers, whoſe Name was <hi>Money,</hi> and had been Quarter-Maſter in the Company of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'arms</hi> belonging to the Dauphin, he formerly loſt a good Sum of Money at play, belonging to the ſaid Company, which had been the occaſion of his leaving <hi>France;</hi> This Officer I ſay, relying upon my Word I had given him, as well as all the reſt, in the Name of the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> that they might ſafely return into <hi>France,</hi> appeared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> where he was ſeen and known by ſome of his former Acquaintance, his buſineſs having made a great noiſe thereabouts ſome Years before. As there are ſeldom wanting, ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65930:146"/>
to curry Favour at the expence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo there was one who went inſtantly to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Povange,</hi> to tell him, that he had been ſeen at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and that he had even had the boldneſs to appear at Court. Monſieur <hi>de Povange,</hi> who did not dream in the leaſt, that he was returned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Orders from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> much leſs, that he had been admitted into his preſence ſince, got immediately a Warrant drawn, which he preſented to the Marqueſs <hi>de Barbeſieux,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ignorant as he, of what concern'd this Officer's return, Signed it without any further delay. The Warrant being given to a certain Officer, whoſe Name was <hi>Deſgrees,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch matters, he watched him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and after he had taken him, carried him to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> where he was committed to the ſame Priſon, which is the ordinary place appointed for Criminals. For it is to be obſerved, that Monſieur <hi>de Povange</hi> intended to Proſecute him with the utmoſt rigour the Law would allow of, to make him an Example to others. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, ſent Orders to Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne,</hi> to draw up an Indictment againſt him; but becauſe his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination was delay'd for ſome time, neither I nor any of the other Officers, had the leaſt notice of what had happened, and hearing no News of him the next day, we were extreamly ſurprized at it. 'Tis true, I began to ſuſpect ſomething of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel him, being ſenſible that he would not have left us thus, and that ſince he was ſo lately come out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>England,</hi> with an intention to ſerve our King, he would not ſo ſoon change his mind.</p>
               <p>When he was taken, he told <hi>Deſgrees,</hi> that he had beſt have a care what he did, becauſe he was come over from <hi>England</hi> not only with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi>'s Conſent, but by his expreſs Orders. But <hi>Deſgrees,</hi> who knew he had a ſufficient Warrant for what he had done, did not trouble his Head much about what he ſaid, neither did he think it worth his while to give notice of it to the Marqueſs <hi>de
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65930:146"/>
Louvois,</hi> though he had promiſed the Priſoner that he would; he did indeed give an Account of it to Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne,</hi> who being as careleſs in the buſineſs as the other, was not over haſty to come to a Legal Examination of the whole matter.</p>
               <p>Thus a whole Week paſſed away, which his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Officers, who heard no tidings of him all this while, ſpent in a great deal of inquietude; the more, becauſe they diſcovered that one <hi>Loiſillon</hi> a Bailiff, had laid a Trap to Arreſt another of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whoſe Adverſary was a Perſon of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and one of the chief Managers of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Affairs. 'Tis true, his Cauſe was not of ſuch ill Conſequence as the others; the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being no more than an Execution againſt him, by vertue of a pretended Marriage contracted with a certain young Woman, who, with the aſſiſtance of her Mother and the ſaid Judge, intended to have catched him in the Snare. The whole was of little Moment at firſt, and would have proved of as little Conſequence, if this Officer, whoſe Name was <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mele,</hi> had rightly underſtood how to manage the Law Suit; but he being negligent in the buſineſs, the Judge, who favoured his Adverſary, had made a chargeable Law Suit of it, and at laſt got Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pay Coſts, Damages, and Intereſt againſt him. They alſo obtained an Execution againſt his Eſtate, lying near <hi>de Laigle,</hi> and would certainly have got into Poſſeſſion of it, if his Mother had not found means to prevent them, and to ſend her Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England;</hi> but it being rumour'd about among ſome of his old Acquaintance, that he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reſt of thoſe before mentioned Officers, to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Judge iſſued his Warrant for <hi>Loiſtillon</hi> to take him, and to carry him to Priſon</p>
               <p>It happened very luckily for <hi>Semele,</hi> that the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of <hi>Mony</hi> had been done ſome time before, which had ſuch an influence upon all the reſt of theſe Officers, that they unanimouſly reſolved for their better ſecurity ſake, not to go at any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance from their Inns, but to paſs their time
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65930:147"/>
away with viſiting one another at their Lodgings. Nay, they were ſo cautious, as not to ſtir abroad, unleſs when there was a good Company of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, notwithſtanding their Inns were very near to one another. <hi>Loiſillon,</hi> who had kept a watchful Eye upon them for ſome time, ſoon began to take notice of their Behaviour, and knowing that they were at leaſt Forty ſtrong, beſides as many Servants, the worſt of whom was able to coap with any of his Followers, thought it his beſt way, not to try them by open force, but to ſurprize <hi>Semele</hi> by ſome Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem or other. For this purpoſe, he got one of his Myrmidons to take Lodgings in the ſame Inn, where he knew this <hi>Semele</hi> lay, whom he intended to trapan. This Fellow, you muſt know, was of a very goodly Aſpect, having not the leaſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in his Garb and all outward appearance to a Bailiff's Follower; but the worſt was, that his Converſation was in nowiſe anſwerable to his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, which made him ſoon be ſuſpected by thoſe who thought it their beſt way to be always upon their Guard. This <hi>Semele</hi> eſpecially, at whom he aim'd, being a very ſhrewd young Fellow, not eaſily to be catch'd in the Trap, and not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that he had to do with a very potent Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, who would be ready upon all occaſions to ſerve him a bad turn, was more jealous of him than all the reſt; the more, when he obſerved that he ſhewed more Complaiſance for him than the others, even to a degree of Flattery, by giving his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Approbation to every thing he ſaid or did. All his Addreſſes were made chiefly to him; ſometimes he would propoſe to treat him with an <hi>Opera,</hi> ſometimes with a Play, ſometimes he would find out ſome other Diverſions to paſs his time away. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mele,</hi> who was as thorow paced in the Art of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation as the Bailiff's Fellow could poſſibly be, pretended to give Ear to what he ſaid, with an intention to ſound him to the bottom; but withal, told him that he uſed not to accept of ſuch Treats from People, but if he had a mind they ſhould go
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65930:147"/>
to Play together, they would play a Game at Cards who ſhould pay for the other. The Fellow was very willing to accept his Propoſition, and loſt his Game on purpoſe to have the Opportunity to carry this <hi>Semele,</hi> and two of his Fellow Officers, who had play'd with them at <hi>Semele</hi>'s requeſt, to ſee a Play. The reſt of the Officers, who ſmelt the Rat, offered to play with him likewiſe upon the ſame lay; but the Setter, whoſe Buſineſs was not to go in ſo great a Company, refuſed to play with any more of them.</p>
               <p>The next day he offered to carry thoſe three who had play'd with him, to the Play, but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be more willing to delay it to another Day, he urged them ſo much that Day, that ſome of the Officers took a reſolution among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to throw him without more a-do out of the Window; there were ſome who were not altogether ſo hot-headed as the reſt, thought it more adviſeable not to come to ſuch an extremity, at leaſt, not till ſuch time they were fully convinced of the whole truth; for this purpoſe, they got one of their Servants, whom they knew to be a pickled Rogue, to follow this Setter at ſome diſtance, and to obſerve all his Motions. This young Fellow acquitted himſelf ſo well of his Commiſſion, and watched all his ſteps ſo narrowly, that he obſerved him to talk with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others of this Bailiff's Followers in the Streets, as he went along, and at laſt ſaw him go into <hi>Loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon</hi>'s Houſe. They needed no more to 'be fully ſatisfied of what they were in ſome doubt of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and ſo took an unanimous reſolution to treat him with a Play, in which he was to act the chief part. After his return to the Inn, they did not fail to give him a Reception ſuitable to their Reſolution; for firſt, he had ſuch a ſound Baſting beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he had never met with ſuch an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment before in all his life time; but this was not all, for they took him, and laid him upon his back in a Bed, where they tyed his Hands and Feet to the four Bed-poſts; being in this poſture, one
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65930:148"/>
Pulled down his Breeches, whilſt another ſtood by with a great ſharp Knife in his hand ready to emaſculate him, unleſs he would make a ſincere Confeſſion, who had ſet him at work, and upon whom he had had a Deſign. The poor Fellow, who was very glad he could preſerve his Stones by telling the truth, confeſſed the whole matter, and ſo was diſcharged for this time.</p>
               <p>I did not very well know what to think of it, which made me ſend a Letter to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to deſire leave to come and wait on him, not daring to venture to go without his permiſſion after the command he had laid upon me, not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at Court, either at <hi>Verſailles</hi> or <hi>Meudon.</hi> When I had the honour to ſee him, I gave him a Relation of what had happened with the Bailiff's Follower, and told him likewiſe, that none of us having heard any News from Monſieur <hi>Mony,</hi> and the Officers imagining no leſs than that he had been betray'd and encloſed in ſome Priſon or other, they were ſo alarm'd at it, that they were upon the point of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a reſolution to diſperſe, and leave <hi>France</hi> for their own Security ſake, unleſs he would be pleaſed to give them ſome aſſurance of his Protection. He promiſed to take care of their Safety, which he did accordingly, by granting them a Protection under his Hand and Seal. He told me further, that it was true that <hi>Mony</hi> had been taken up, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Priſoner to the Priſon of <hi>Vincennes,</hi> by vertue of a Warrant Signed by his own Son, but that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de li R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne,</hi> who had had him under Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had no ſooner given him notice of what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had happened to him by a miſtake; but he had given Orders for his Releaſe immediately; and that he was ſure I would meet with him at his Inn, after my return to <hi>Paris.</hi> He commanded me to tell all theſe <hi>French</hi> Officers there, to be ready at an hours warning, to go into <hi>Ireland</hi> with the Count of <hi>Lauſun,</hi> who was to command in that Kingdom, as General, inſtead of Monſieur <hi>de Roſe,</hi> who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſerved there in the ſame Quality, but had
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65930:148"/>
made very preſſing Inſtances at Court to be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with recalled from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Service.</p>
               <p>I took once more this opportunity to put this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in mind of the payment of the Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and alſo of the Money due to the Inns, where theſe Officers had been provided with all Neceſſaries all this while. I did not forbear to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent my caſe as miſerable to him as poſſibly I could; I told him how the Banker, unto whom I was to pay the ſaid Bill of Exchange, had taken a Warrant out againſt me, ſo that I was every day in danger of ſeeing my ſelf hurried to Priſon; that to gain ſome time, I had alſo brought my Wife in the lurch, who being engaged for the payment of the Debt, was now in the ſame danger as my ſelf; ſo that inſtead of meliorating my Condition, I had made it worſe, neither of us daring now to ſtir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, unleſs when guarded by a good Company of Friends; for fear of being carried to Priſon. But whatever I could ſay or do, I could get no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer from him, than what I had had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times before; the only additional Comfort he gave me, was, that he would ſpeak to the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; and that for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fear he ſhould forget it, I ſhould be ſure to write to him after my return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to repreſent the trouble and vexation I lay under, for want of the payment of this Money, and that it was impoſſible for me to hold out any longer, unleſs he would be pleaſed to ſend me ſpeedy relief.</p>
               <p>I am fully perſwaded, there will ſcarce be any body that reads theſe Memoirs, but what will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with me in Opinion, that there muſt be ſome Myſtery in this Buſineſs; for what probability can there be elſe, to ſuppoſe, that conſidering the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition the King's Treaſury was in at that time, and ſince, ſo great a Miniſter as he, ſhould ſuffer himſelf thus to be Dunn'd for ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a Sum, eſpecially if it be conſidered, that there could not be a more juſt Debt than this, which I had contracted by his Majeſty's Order, and for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65930:149"/>
his Service. But beſides that, the King himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altogether inſenſible of it, (without whoſe Approbation, I ſuppoſe, the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> would ſcarce have ventured to recal theſe Officers out of <hi>England</hi>) all theſe Officers themſelves are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Witneſſes on my ſide, as well as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Jalet,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Steward, and the Inn-keepers where they were Lodged; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Maſter of the Inn at the Sign of the <hi>Flower-de-Luce,</hi> in the <hi>Bear-ſtreet;</hi> the Maſter of the Inn at the <hi>Iron Croſs</hi> in St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Inn at the Sign of the <hi>Tortoiſe,</hi> near the <hi>Chatelet.</hi> The beſt Conſtruction I can make of the whole, is, that this Miniſter did uſe me thus, with no other intent than to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fit to put in Execution at this critical Juncture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he was ſufficiently inſtructed by what he had underſtood out of the two laſt Letters from <hi>England,</hi> written by the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . . and my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . that they were fully ſatisfied of the good Intentions of the Gentlemen in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and that they would take up Arms as ſoon as they ſhould make a Deſcent upon the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt; I ſay, he being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, did not think he could pitch upon a better Expedient to divert them from undertaking this Enterprize, than if, by ſending me to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he gave them to underſtand, that their whole Deſign had been diſcovered. He did not queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that they would ſoon be inform'd by their Spyes of what had happened to me, by which means, he propoſed to ſave the <hi>French</hi> Court the trouble of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning a great many Proteſtant Gentlemen of that Province, who were ſuppoſed to be well Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65930:149"/>
to the Enemies Deſign; which he fear'd might make ſo great a noiſe in the Kingdom, as to prove the Fore-runner of ſome other Commotions, which might be attended with fatal Conſequences; being reſolved, as I told you before, to prevent this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by my Impriſonment, he ſpoke to me very coldly, when I came to wait on him the next time at <hi>Meudon,</hi> though I am ſure I took all imaginable care to repreſent my Caſe to him with the utmoſt reſpect, all what I told him, amounting only to this; that it was now near two Months ſince he had delayed me from one time to another, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me any real ſatisfaction, according to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was diſcourſing with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> a certain Perſon of Quality came to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt me in my Complaints, which I found were not at all unpleaſing to this Miniſter, who, as I believe, did ſuppoſe, that by giving me a blunt anſwer, I would be provok'd to ſuch a degree, as might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with a fair opportunity to put his Deſign in execution againſt me, under that pretence. But at that time he was forced to leave me to my ſelf, being obliged to go to Court, and I as ſoon as I had ſeen him in his Coach, return'd directly to <hi>Paris,</hi> whither my Buſineſſes called me. Not long after, I received more Letters from <hi>England,</hi> in which, both the Earl of <hi>S</hi> . . . . . and my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . did acquaint me, that they were in the greateſt Surprize in the World, becauſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Letters from me, for ſome time before; they told me, that every thing was ready on their ſide for a Deſcent upon the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt; and that therefore they would have me not be diſcouraged, if hitherto I had not met with all the Succeſs I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Province of <hi>Poictou;</hi> for though they were not upon the Spot, as I was, yet they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Aſſurance, that a great Number of the Inhabitants of that Province, would be at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, whenever they ſhould ſee them ſet footing on the <hi>French</hi> Shoar. I carried theſe Letters, before I
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:65930:150"/>
opened them, to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who was just then come back to <hi>Meudon,</hi> and after he had peruſed them, told me the Contents as I have related them; and that he would carry them forth with to the King at <hi>Verſailles;</hi> he ordered me at the ſame time to attend him the next following <hi>Friday</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where I ſhould receive His Majeſty's Commands, whether I ſhould anſwer them or not, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meaſures the King would be pleaſed to have me take. I began my old Tune again, and to talk to him about the Money concerns, which lay ſo heavy upon me at that time; but no ſooner had I begun, but he interrupted me, telling me, that I need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not give my ſelf any further trouble about that matter, becauſe it ſhould be done that very day. I was ſo well acquainted with theſe Expreſſions, which I had heard him repeat to me ſo often, that I did not much rely upon't, perſiſting neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs unmoveable in my former Reſolution, to arm my ſelf with Patience againſt any Event that might befall me.</p>
               <p>According to this Miniſters appointment, I came to wait on him the next following <hi>Friday.</hi> He had ſhew'd the before mentioned Letters which had been ſent to me out of <hi>England,</hi> to our King, and if I am not extreamly miſtaken in my gueſs, had repreſented to him, that it was now high time to make me a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> this being the moſt proper Expedient they could pitch upon, to oblige the Enemy to lay aſide their Enterprize of making a Deſcent upon the <hi>French</hi> Coaſt, that unleſs they did ſo, they muſt at leaſt ſend twelve Thouſand Men for the defence of thoſe Ports, who might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed better in another place; or elſe they muſt fill up all the Priſons there abouts with many of the Proteſtant Nobility, and others of the chief Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Country; neither do I much queſtion, but that the King over-perſwaded by his Reaſons, did at laſt give Ear to his Counſel.</p>
               <p>For I was no ſooner entred his Cloſet, but the firſt thing he ask'd me abruptly, was, whether I had
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65930:150"/>
not ſent any Letters into <hi>England</hi> ſince that time he gave me his Expreſs Orders to the contrary. I anſwered him, I had not, of which, if he pleaſed, he might be convinced by the Contents of thoſe laſt Letters I had delivered to him, in which they complained of my neglect in not writing to them. He ſeem'd in all outward appearance, to be ſatisfied with what I had offered in anſwer to his queſtion, and again told me, that it was the King's abſolute Pleaſure, I ſhould ſend no more Letters into <hi>England.</hi> After he had done with this Subject, I began the old Song, and put him in mind, that the laſt time I had had the Honour to wait on him at <hi>Meudon,</hi> he had made me a poſitive promiſe to deliver me that very day from thoſe Troubles I lay under on account of the Bill of Exchange, and the Debts due to the Inn-Keepers, where the <hi>French</hi> Officers were Lodged; ſcarce had I uttered theſe words, when interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with a ſtern Look, he gave me no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but this; <hi>You are very haſty indeed; I am apt to believe you are afraid the King is ready to break.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, an anſwer ſo unexpected, did raiſe in me ſome motions which I was not able to hide with all the art I had; nevertheleſs, I anſwered him without the leaſt tranſgreſſing the bounds of reſpect due to his high Station; that nothing did grieve me more at this time, than to ſee my ſelf reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch hard Circumſtances, as to be forced to be ſo urgent with him, aſſuring him, that nothing but an unavoidable Neceſſity could oblige me to it. I told him further, that if I durſt be ſo bold, as to deſire him to put himſelf for once in my place, I did not queſtion, but he would be ſenſible, that I was leſs urgent than he would be himſelf if he were under the ſame ill Circumſtances; for as the caſe now ſtood, I durſt ſcarce ſtir out of Doors, or if I did, I could not go three ſteps without looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſee whether there were not a Bailiff at my Heels to drag me to Priſon; that if with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution I could make uſe of againſt their Attempts upon my Perſon, I had had the good Fortune hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

He gave me no other Anſwer but ſome ſharp, biting words, which touched me ſo nearly, that not being able to brook any longer with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuch an affront, which I was ſenſible I had ſo little deſerved at his Hands, I reply'd to him yet in very reſpectful Terms: That if he knew that his Majeſty had no preſent occaſion to employ theſe Officers, I deſired him to oblige me thus far, as to tell me ſo, that I might find out a way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Victim, which was to be Sacrificed for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the State. I think this Night was the worſt and the longeſt that ever I knew in my life, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible that any Man living could be diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more various Agitations of mind than I was at that time. I had this additional Affliction, that ſeveral of my Friends, who perceived me to be in ſo odd an Humour, were very inquiſitive to know the real cauſe of my preſent Afflictions, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was ſuch, that it had diſinabled me to give them a rational Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The next Morning one of theſe <hi>French</hi> Officers, lately come from <hi>England,</hi> by my Orders, happened to pay me a Viſit in my Bed-Chamber, when they were juſt bringing up the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette, Publiſhed that ſame Morning. As I had but little cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to look after News at that time, I threw it upon the Table, and the Officer took it up, and after he had peruſed ſome few Paragraphs in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told me, that two Gentlemen of the Province of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctou,</hi> had been taken up, for keeping Correſpondence with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) This unexpected News raiſed me all on a ſudden out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Lethargy that had ſeized my Spirits for want of Reſt, which made me immediately ask the Officer, where it was that he had read this News? Then he pointing with his Finger upon the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, I found that it was Monſieur . . . . . and Monſieur . . . . . who had been confined upon that account. That which made me immediately ſuſpect the matter, and that their Names were not inſerted in this Gazette without ſome particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, was, becauſe I was too well acquainted with the nature of our <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette, where ſeldom any thing of this kind is put in, without particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from Court.</p>

He was ſo forward, as to give me no leiſure to make many Reflections upon the matter, or to ask him what bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he had in my Lodgings; he ſav'd me, I ſay this trouble; for he had no ſooner ſet one Foot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room, but he accoſted me with this Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he was ſorry it was his Lot to bring me the ill-news, that he was ſent to take me into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the King's ſpecial Command, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt deſire me to dreſs my ſelf with all ſpeed. I give every body leave to judge how ſurprizing this Meſſage muſt be to me, which ſtruck me with ſuch an Amazement, that I was not able to hide it from thoſe that were near us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſgrees</hi> ſeeing me in this condition, did what he could to comfort me, aſſuring me, that he believed my Buſineſs would not be of ſo much conſequence, as I might be apt to imagine; becauſe the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> had given him poſitive Orders to treat me like a Gentleman; and that the King had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permiſſion to me, to write to my Wife, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Domeſtick Affairs as I ſhould think conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But theſe Sugar-plums had but a ſlender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with me at this time, when I little expected to be thus Rewarded for the great Services I had done; however, I began to dreſs my ſelf, but with ſo much Perplexity, and in ſuch a Confuſion, that I did ſcarce know my ſelf what I was going about to do; and I ask'd for ſome Pens, Ink and Paper, which being brought up to me, I ask'd <hi>Deſgrees</hi> whither he was to carry me, and what was the reaſon of my Confinement? But he refuſing to give me any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Anſwer to either, I writ to my Spouſe, and acquainted her with my preſent unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; I deſired her to come forthwith to Court,

and to hear from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi>'s own Mouth, unto what place I was Confined, and the true reaſon of my Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was buſie in Dreſſing my ſelf, in comes a Commiſſary, (Juſtice of the Peace) into my Chamber, who happend to be juſt the ſame Perſon, by whoſe aſſiſtance I delivered my Spouſe's Chamber-Maid out of the clutches of a Bawd in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was near ten Years ago ſince that time, and though he had not ſeen me above twice or thrice i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>It happened that Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernour, was not at home at that time; and the place of Deputy-Governour, being alſo vacant, he who had the Supreme Management of Affairs in the Governour's abſence, was indeed a Creature of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but durſt not do any thing of moment without his particular Order.</p>
               <p>So I was fain to ſtay a conſiderable while in a large Room belonging to the Governour, till they could give him notice that he had a new Gue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> brought to his Caſtle; he being then gone abroad to ſee his Son.</p>
               <p>After his return home, <hi>la Nove,</hi> (which was the Name of him that Officiated in his abſence) gave him an account of my Name and Condition, (as he had underſtood it from the Meſſenger) whereupon the Governour ordered me to be lodged in the To<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wer of the Chappel, up three pair of Stairs. There was at that time another Priſoner in the ſame Cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber, whoſe Name was <hi>Voile,</hi> a Man of Fortune nay, even of a very mean Extraction. He had been Comptroller of the King's Plate-Office, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> which means he and one of his Brothers, (who had been one of Monſieur <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Clerks) had gather<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65930:153"/>
vaſt Riches. The Furniture of this Room was anſwerable to his great Eſtate; being hung with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Tapeſtry Hangings, with a fine Damask Bed, Silk Chairs, and all the other things propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. In this Room I was quartered with my Servant, and kept under Lock and Key. For you muſt know that the Priſoners in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> are of two different kinds: For ſome are kept encloſed betwixt four Brick Walls, from whence they don't get ſight of any body living, unleſs it be the Door-keeper of the Priſon, whom they call the Key Bearer. They are not permitted as much as to go and hear Maſs, though they be never ſo Zealous Catholicks, unleſs it be at the four grand Feaſts of the Year; nay, ſome are ſo cloſely Confined, that they have not that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty granted them.</p>
               <p>I did obſerve at my firſt coming into the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> that the Governour uſed ſometimes to give them a viſit, and ſo did ſome of the other Officers; but this being look'd upon as too great a Favour, it is out of date now. Theſe are the greateſt part of thoſe who have the misfortune to be Priſoners in the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> the reſt, much fewer in number, have the liberty of the Court to walk in, and are kept under Lock and Key only at certain Hours.</p>
               <p>The Governour was a Friend of this <hi>Voile,</hi> or at leſt pretended to be ſuch, for ſcarce a day paſt, but he either came in perſon to pay him a viſit, or at leaſt ſent his Dequty <hi>la Nove</hi> to do it in his Name. They would both manage him as they thought it beſt for their purpoſe, all their Viſits being to no other end than to bring him either good or bad News, in relation to his Buſineſs, according as they were directed to do; for they did not dare to make one ſtep without particular Orders from Court, or at leaſt, theſe are my Thoughts of it, which I have founded upon thoſe Obſervations, I have had occaſion to make, during my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:65930:154"/>I am well convinced that <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour, is too much a Politician, to act the part of a Friend with any Priſoner under his Cuſtody, which is a convincing Argument to me, that all his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes are made to them for no other end than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle them into what the Miniſters of State would have done. This <hi>Voile</hi> was accuſed of Bribery, and other Miſmanagements in his Office, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and his Deputy, employed moſt of their Viſits in making him ſenſible of what Puniſhment he had deſerved, which could not be bought off but with a conſiderable Sum of Money. To tell the truth, they had need to make uſe of all their beſt Rhetorick to perſwade him to it; for he loved Money ſo well, that he would ſooner have loſt a Limb than parted with any of it, and nothing but the dread of a ſevere Puniſhment could have ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Gold from him.</p>
               <p>After theſe Preparatives adminiſtred to him by the Governour and his Deputy, Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne</hi> came ſometime after, to give a thorough Purgation; for he had him for four Hours together, under a ſtrict Examination, which agreed ſo ill with his preſent Conſtitution, that when he came up to our Chamber again, he look'd no otherwiſe than if he was ready to ſink into the Ground. I ask'd him, what was the reaſon I obſerved ſo ſudden a Change in his Countenance, and what made him look ſo dejected? He anſwered me no more than this, that rather than to appear once more in the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne,</hi> he would give all what he was worth in the whole World.</p>
               <p>This Anſwer ſeem'd to intimate that he had been ſoundly frightned by him, and I was of Opinion that he had threatned him with no leſs than the Rope. But whilſt I was a little pauſing upon the matter, the Odoriferous Smell which I began to perceive to iſſue from his Breeches, was a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proof to me that I had not been much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in my gueſs; for he had put him into ſuch a condition by his dreadful Diſcourſe, that his <hi>Valet</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:65930:154"/>
was fain to do him the ſame Office as Nurſes are uſed to do to the young Babes.</p>
               <p>It was no eaſie task to forbear laughing at ſuch an Adventure as this; and for my part, I was forced almoſt to bite my Lips through, to keep my ſelf from it, for fear he ſhould perceive me: But both his and my Servant were ſuch unlucky Rogues, that they laugh'd in one anothers Faces in his preſence, which made him Swear heartily at his own, and to make his Complaints againſt mine to me. The conſequence of the matter was, that the Words of Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne,</hi> who had had ſuch a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence upon his Poſteriors, (the ſcent of which had queſtionleſs, alſo reach'd the Examiner's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils) together with the perſwaſions of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> bad got a no leſs powerful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant over <hi>de Voile</hi>'s Inclinations; for contrary to his natural Conſtitution, which was not to part with a Farthing, he was willing enough to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe his Liberty at ſuch a rate as they were pleaſed to ſet upon it. Thus I loſt my Chamber-fellow; but this was not the worſt; for in a few days after he had been diſcharged out of Priſon, an Uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer came up into my Lodging-Room, who took down the Tapeſtry-Hangings, and removed all the reſt of the Furniture, which had made the Room appear hitherto pretty tolerable to me. But after theſe Ornaments were removed, I obſerved a ſtrange Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe in every thing; for now every thing there beginning to appear in its natural Colours, I found that they had Quartered me in the ſame Room where formerly they uſed to put the Criminals upon the Rack. The Turn Key could not diſown it himſelf, but if he had, there were thick Iron-Rings at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance from one another faſtned to the Walls, on which they uſed to tye the Ropes, by which they uſed to hang theſe unfortunate Wretches; which were plain demonſtrations to me, that I was not miſtaken in my Opinion.</p>
               <p>Thus I was fain to ſpend my time in this diſmal place without any Company; the only comfort I
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65930:155"/>
had, was, that my Window look'd into the Garden of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where there was a very agreeable Proſpect, and I uſed to ſpend many an hour at that Window to refreſh my ſelf in ſome meaſure, when I was almoſt ſpent with thoſe doleful Reflections that had over-whelm'd me with Grief; among thoſe, the abſence of my Spouſe was none of the leaſt, and I frequently ſent a longing ſight for her coming, in hopes, that ſome way or other, ſhe might prove inſtrumental in delivering me from this cloſe Confinement, which I could attribute to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a certain Fatality that attended me at that time.</p>
               <p>One day as I was thus looking out at my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, I ſaw the Lieutenant of the Guards of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Garenne,</hi> and who was a Kinſman of the Governour, to enter the Garden with Monſieur <hi>la Nove,</hi> and a certain Priſoner, who had the liberty to walk in the Garden of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> once a Week. They were followed by one of their Attendance, with two Bottles of Wine in one hand, and a Diſh covered with a Napkin, and ſome cold Victuals in the other. They fell to drinking briskly about, and were very merry together; an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſight to thoſe that were coup'd up at the ſame time betwixt four Walls, and were fain to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but not Partakers of their Paſtime, from the Windows that look'd into the Garden. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at this Sport till it began to be dusky, and <hi>Garenne</hi> ſent his Servant back to have the Bottles fill'd again; whilſt this Fellow was gone to obey his Maſter's Orders, the Priſoner, who was an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh man,</hi> called <hi>Sewel,</hi> pretended to be preſſed to ſtep aſide, and ſo went at ſome diſtance from the other two towards that part of the Garden which faces the Wood-Yards, where he faſtned a Rope to the Wall, and ſo got over it undiſcovered by the reſt.</p>
               <p>When the Servant came back with the Bottles, he found <hi>Garenne</hi> looking after the Priſoner; at which he could ſcarce forbear laughing, becauſe he knew him
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65930:155"/>
to be ſo Purblind, that he could at the beſt, not ſee above a yards length from him. After they had ſearch'd all the places round the Garden, they found at laſt the Rope, which being a ſufficient ſign to them, which way the Priſoner had taken; they cry'd out for help, becauſe one of the Priſoners had made his eſcape. They put the whole <hi>Baſtile</hi> in alarm, by their crying out as they paſſed through the Garden and the Caſtle, and ſent inſtantly all their Myrmidons abroad, to ſearch in all Corners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> but in vain; for the Bird was fled paſt recovery. <hi>Garenne</hi> likewiſe bid them farewell, being afraid of Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> and as the Turn-key told me, he was fled into <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> where he would ſcarce be ſecure, becauſe Orders were come from Court to make ſearch after him all over the Kingdom, and to take him where-ever he could be met with.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe dreadful pretences, this Priſoner, who was a very ſenſible Fellow, got ſafely into <hi>England,</hi> without being diſcovered by any; which indeed was no hard task for him to do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the whole matter, as I have related it juſt now, was nothing elſe but a Grimace contrived betwixt him and the Governour, by Order from Court. For it is to be obſerved, that this Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem had been made uſe of by King <hi>James,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (King <hi>William</hi> III.) that this Priſoner, after his eſcape out of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where he had been put at his Requeſt) had taken ſuch an averſion to his Party, that to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the affront put upon him, he would be ready to embrace the Prince's (King <hi>William</hi> III.) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

By this means they hoped he might inſinuate into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and meet with an opportunity to give King <hi>James</hi> an Account of ſeveral matters of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

I firſt gave notice of this Contrivance to a certain <hi>German,</hi> one of our fellow Priſoners, who found means to communicate it to the reſt, and ſo we kept up our Correſpondence together for two whole Years, before it was diſcovered.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I got another Chamber-fellow, whoſe Name was <hi>Villeroy,</hi> a Native of <hi>Lorrain</hi> of the City of <hi>Vaucouleurs,</hi> who had been an Officer in the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Regiment of <hi>Surlauben.</hi> I ask'd him upon what account he had been ſent to the <hi>Baſtile?</hi> (where he remains Priſoner to this Day.) If it be true what he ſays, his only Crime was to have been ſo fortunate, as to be beloved by a certain Lady of Quality, whoſe Husband having conceived ſome Jealouſie at him, prevailed with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to ſend him to Priſon. I muſt confeſs, he was a very handſome Fellow, and if it be ſo as he pretends, this Lady is not the firſt of the fair Sex who has been Captivated by a handſome outſide. But however it be, they had taken him up under this pretext, that he being a Native of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> had been employed by the late Duke <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> to raiſe a Regiment for his Service. It was true, he had been raiſing ſome new Levies, but they were raiſed for the Count <hi>de Teſſe,</hi> unto whom the King had given a Commiſſion to raiſe a new Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Foot, of which this Priſoner was to have been Major.</p>
               <p>At that time both he and I were as yet of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man (<hi>Sewell</hi>) had made a real eſcape, the Myſtery of it being not as then come to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65930:157"/>
our knowledge, which made us enter into a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whether it might not be poſſible for us to do the ſame thing like it, for our Deliverance. At laſt we agreed upon the matter; and I found means with ſome Inſtruments I had privately convey'd to me, to looſen the Bricks round about the Window, where the Iron Grates were faſtned; ſo Artificially, that I could put them again into their places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceived by the Turn-key<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs he had look'd very near upon them: The deſire of Liberty did ſo quicken my hands, that it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had almoſt Compaſſed my Labour, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above one days Work left to accompliſh it; the only thing we wanted now, was how to get Ropes to let our ſelves down from the Tower, which was pretty high. I had taken notice of ſome old Ropes, that uſed to lye in a great Room, thro' which one muſt paſs into ours, which was indeed, always kept lock'd up by the Turn-key, but we had ſome time leave given us, whilſt he was in our Chamber, to go into it, to eaſe our ſelves, or upon ſome other occaſion.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, That theſe Ropes belonged to the Lady <hi>Curton,</hi> Daughter to the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and were made uſe of, to draw up the Hay into the Hay-loft, for the uſe of her Horſes, when ſhe reſided at <hi>Paris:</hi> Her Servants had left them in this Room, together with ſome odd Houſe hold Goods, as they were going into the Country of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,</hi> where the Marqueſs her Husband, had a very good Eſtate. I ſpoke of it to <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and he, and I, and my Servant, (who was a very crafty Rogue) had another Conſultation how to convey theſe Ropes into our Chamber, without being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Turn-key; my <hi>Valet</hi> undertook the Task, and the better to encompaſs it, he put on the ſame Night he intend to go about it, an Old Night Gown, which I had given him before. As ſoon as he heard the Turn-key rattle his Keys near our Chamber, he threw himſelf upon the Bed, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he was not very well; and after the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65930:157"/>
was come in, he feigned himſelf ſo weak, as ſcarce to be able to crawl into the next Room, where he pretended to look into an Old Ward-robe he had, but by this means got ſight of the Ropes; their bulk did a little ſurprize him at firſt, but after the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key was gone, he told us, he would not deſiſt till he had conveyed them to us, provided we would take care to entertain the Turn-key the next day, for ſome time, which we promiſed to do.</p>
               <p>Purſuant to our agreement, we diverted him the next day a conſiderable time, with variety of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which gave my <hi>Valet</hi> the opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs his part of the deſign, ſo that all we had to do now, was to ſave our ſelves through the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by the help of theſe Ropes.</p>
               <p>But before I would make my eſcape, I had a mind to bid farewell to the Duke <hi>de la Force,</hi> who being a Priſoner in another Tower, not far diſtant from ours; we had kept a continual Correſpondence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ever ſince I was a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> by the help of a hole which reach'd quite thro' the Wall. I was not very willing his Servants ſhould be Witneſſes of what I had to Communicate to him; which made me Write a Letter, in which I gave him an account of my deſign, and conveyed it to him by the help of an Engine, which reach'd from one ſide of the hole to the other.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner read the Letter, and pauſed a little upon the matter, but he ſent me an Anſwer by the ſame Engine, in which he told me, that he could not believe otherwiſe, but that my caſe muſt be much worſe than it had been repreſented to him, by me, for without that, he could ſcarce imagine how I could pitch upon ſuch an expedient as this, to obtain my Liberty. That I would do very well to take it once more into ſerious Conſideration; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that I was to put my Life in moſt Eminent danger, by letting my ſelf down by a Rope from the Tower; which was near Fourſcore Foot high, if I happened to ſucceed in this, I ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that there would be no ſafety for me in <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:65930:158"/>
hereafter; that therefore, if I knew my ſelf guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would not diſſwade me from attempting it, but if not, he could not adviſe me in the leaſt to it. That if nevertheleſs I perſiſted in my reſolution to venture at all, he wiſhed me a happy Succeſs, but that his adviſe was, to conſider once more of it be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I put it in execution. His Reaſons had ſo powerful an influence over me that I began really to ponder again the matter with all the ſeriouſneſs imaginable, and after I had maturely weighed all the Circumſtances, and dangerous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were likely to attend it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I reſolved to hearken to his Counſel; this made me tell <hi>Villeroy,</hi> that if he thought fit, he might ſave himſelf alone, and that I would not hinder his eſcape, but for my part, I had altered my mind. Both he and my Servant were much diſſatisfied at it, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our Countenances for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time after, being quite tired out with the irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs of a cloſe Confinement. However, the Officer did not think fit to attempt his eſcape with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me.</p>
               <p>Sometime after I was carried to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> my Siſter came to <hi>Paris,</hi> at the requeſt of my Spouſe, who being much indiſpoſed at that time, could not poſſibly come her ſelf. She went to Court, where addreſſing her ſelf to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> he told her, that he could not grant me my liberty, but that ſhe might have leave to ſee me. The firſt time ſhe came to me, ſhe gave me an account of my Domeſtick Affairs, but above all the reſt, how my Spouſe was quite overwhelmed with Grief, which had reduced her to a very low condition, her Trouble being much augmented, ſince ſhe had read in the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette, that I was accuſed of keeping Correſpondence with the Enemy. For it is to be obſerved, that I had been put in the Gazette in the ſame Rank with the other two Gentlemen of <hi>Poictou,</hi> whom I mentioned before, though it was evident to the Court, that what I had done, was of a quite different nature from what was laid to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65930:158"/>
their charge. But conſidering this Expedient had been pitch'd upon to give the Enemy to underſtand by our Impriſonment; that their Correſpondence in <hi>Poictou</hi> was diſcovered, the Court did not think fit to make any difference betwixt us, as being moſt ſuitable to what they propoſed to themſelves, and it was queſtionleſs upon this account, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> had ordered us to be put in the Gazette, without making the leaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the guilty and innocent.</p>
               <p>The anſwer I gave to my Siſter, was, that I could give her no greater and more convincing Proof of my innocence, than her being admitted to ſee me at her firſt Requeſt, which was never granted to ſuch as are guilty of any capital Crime; beſides that, I had not been under Examination, and what is more, I never have been Examined all this while ſince I am a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> an evident proof that I was only pitch'd upon to ſerve for an unfortunate Victim, to be Sacrificed for the Intereſt of the State. This may, perhaps, ſeem ſtrange to ſome who are unacquainted with the preſent State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>France;</hi> but I can aſſure you that I am not the only Perſon under theſe unhappy Circumſtances; I ſay I am not the only Perſon who have been thrown into this diſmal Priſon to ſerve a State's turn upon an occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there being to my own certain knowledge, above thirty more, who are not guilty of any thing elſe but to be ſo unfortunate, as to have been ſelected among many others, to ſatisfie the Politick ends of the Court, and have for many years Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in this Priſon, where, in all likelyhood they will die Martyrs of State.</p>
               <p>As often as my Siſter came to ſee me, ſhe uſed commonly to pay a Viſit to Monſieur <hi>de Baiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naux,</hi> the Governour of the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that he is a Perſon of excellent Natural Parts at all times, which, whenever his Intereſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, he knows how to improve to his utmoſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. My Siſter was always look'd upon as one who was not eaſily to be trapp'd, notwithſtanding

which he would manage her ſo dexterouſly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſhe could not forbear to tell him all what ſhe knew. Thus ſhe gave him an Account how ſhe had been at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> to ſollicit my Liberty, but had met b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> with very ſlender encouragement, and that indeed ſhe began almoſt to deſpair of it, unleſs I could make ſome very ſtrong Intereſt; ſhe further told him, how ſhe was to go back into the Country to give an account of it to my Spouſe, the beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient ſhe knew, being for her to come up to Court with all poſſible ſpeed, to throw her ſelf at his Majeſty's Feet, and declare to him my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; that perhaps the King might be moved with Compaſſion towards a Lady who lived in a ſtrange Country, and had a great Family to provide for; for it is to be obſerved, that I had at that time eight Children living, to wit, two Sons and ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Daughters; and it was no ſmall increaſe of my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that I ſaw my ſelf reduced to ſuch a miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition, as not to be able to aſſiſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but above all the reſt, nothing troubled me more, than the continual fear I was in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that conſidering they lived in a Province where there were great numbers of Hereticks, my Spouſe might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon by them, to return to her former Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and that if ſuch a thing ſhould come to paſs, ſhe would unqueſtionably influence her Children to tread in her foot-ſteps.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> who knew well enough that they had nothing of moment againſt me, was afraid that if my Spouſe ſhould come to Court, ſhe might obtain my Enlargement; for he had nine Livres <hi>per Diem,</hi> allow'd him for me and my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and he paid no more than about four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſix Pence a day to thoſe who provided our Victuals; by which means he has heap'd up vaſt Treaſures, he being reputed to be worth two Millions of Livres; and has always lived in grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> State. Beſides that to each of his two Daughters, he has given a Portion of a Hundred Thouſand Crowns when they were Married, and has ſettled
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65930:159"/>
an Eſtate of thirty thouſand Livres <hi>per Annum,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Son. All theſe vaſt Riches he has ſqueezed out of the poor Priſoners under his Cuſtody; for you muſt know, that though indeed he was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by Extraction, a Native of <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> yet he was not born to an Eſtate, and was not look'd upon as a Man of any conſiderable Fortune when he was made Keeper of the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Perſon I ſay, whoſe Maxim it is, to make uſe of all means poſſible to keep in his Hands as long as he can, thoſe who have the misfortune to come once under his Clutches; having underſtood from my Siſter, what means ſhe propoſed for my Releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, acted the Hypocrite ſo to the life, that even the moſt quick ſighted might have been deceived by it. For he told her, that knowing me to be rather unfortunate than guilty, he could not but have a great Compaſſion for me; and that therefore he would give her the beſt Advice he was capable of, being better acquainted with the Court than ſhe. He then told her further, that if my Spouſe ſhould come up to Court, and throw her ſelf at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Feet, he would certainly ſend her back to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> and that for this reaſon it was his Opinion, that ſhe muſt delay this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome time longer, for fear of Exaſperating the ſaid Miniſter, who was already very ill ſatisfied with me, becauſe I had not ſpoke to him in ſuch reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Terms as he expected I ſhould have done. He adviſed her that ſhe ſhould give me an Account of what he had ſaid to her, before I writ to my Spouſe, and that ſhe ſhould aſſure me in his behalf, of his good Inclinations towards me, and that he ſhould be over-joy'd to do me any Service, which he hoped might be in his power in time, if I would truſt him with the Management of it; and that he would not fail to give me timely notice, whenever he thought it ſeaſonable for my Spouſe to come to Town.</p>
               <p>My Siſter gave me a full Account of what he had told her, and I who did not know him ſo well
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65930:160"/>
at that time, as I have had ſufficient occaſion to do ſince, found ſo much probability in what he had offered, that I ſent my Siſter to him, to give him all imaginable Thanks for the good Advice he had been pleaſed to give me, and to aſſure him, that I ſhould always be ready to acknowledge it, and would follow it in particular at this time. When he found that he had brought me thus to his Bow, he came along with my Siſter to pay me a Viſit, and after ſome indifferent Diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> betwixt us, he took me aſide, (being unwilling that my Chamber-fellow ſhould over-hear us) and gave me the ſame Reaſons and Aſſurances he had given to my Siſter before; he told me that he was ready to do me what Service he could, but, that looking upon this Juncture as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable for her appearance at Court in my behalf, he would order ſome Pen, Ink and Paper to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, which I might make uſe of to write to my Spouſe, who, if ſhe ſhould come up to <hi>Paris</hi> at this time, muſt only ſpend her Money there to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is to be obſerved, that thoſe who are cloſe Priſoners in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> are not allowed the uſe of Pen, Ink or Paper, unleſs it be upon a particular occaſion, either by ſpecial Order from Court, or when they have a mind to trapan them, as I was not ignorant of it; ſo this Obligation I believed I received from the Governour to allow me to write to my Spouſe, made me look upon him at that time, no otherwiſe than the beſt of my Friends. Purſuant to his directions, I writ to my Spouſe to forbear coming to <hi>Paris</hi> at preſent, but that ſhe ſhould give a ſtrict charge to my Siſter, to follow Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi>'s directions in every thing. I uſed frequently to tell her the ſame thing, ſo that both ſhe and I were led by the Noſe by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſo long, till tired out of all patience, our Eyes were opened by chance, God whoſe Providence is above the reach of all Humane Wit, having at laſt been pleaſed to make this treacherous Perſon the Inſtrument of the diſcovery of his ill Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:65930:160"/>In the mean while, my Wife was pretty well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of her late Illneſs, and was juſt packing up her Baggage to take Coach for <hi>Paris</hi> the next day, when ſhe received my Letter; this made her put off her Journey for that time, till ſhe might have a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opportunity of receiving Inſtructions from me; but an unexpected Accident obliged her to change her Reſolution when ſhe leaſt thought of it.</p>
               <p>You muſt know therefore, that the Banker and the Inn-Keepers, unto whom I had paſs'd my word for the payment of the Money due to them from the <hi>French</hi> Officers, I have ſo often mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing me detained in Priſon, and deſpairing of all other means to come by their Money, Sued both me and my Land-Lady, (who was Bound with me) to an Execution, and the Banker got into actual Poſſeſſion of my Seat in the Country. My Spouſe ſeeing her ſelf reduced to theſe ill Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, did not think fit to tarry any longer in the Country, but made all the haſt ſhe could to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe took up her Lodgings in the ſame Houſe where I had Lodged before my Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment.</p>
               <p>But ſhe had ſcarce been there two days, when ſhe met with new matter of Affliction. For the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Inn-Keepers ſeized upon the ſaid Land-lady's Houſhold Goods, and other Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; ſhe went ſtreight ways to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who indeed gave her many fair promiſes; but ſuch as ſerved rather to augment than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her in her preſent miſerable Condition. To be ſhort, he either conſidered that if he ſhould give her the Money, ſhe deſired for the payment of this Debt, it might be Interpreted to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and be look'd upon as if his Anger againſt me was rather feigned than real, or elſe he thought it not worth his while to make ſerious Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the misfortune of others; for he was as negligent in performing his Promiſes to her, as he had been to me before; though at the ſame time, it muſt be confeſs'd, that he was not ſo in reſpect of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65930:161"/>
King's Service. For knowing that the King had occaſion for theſe Officers, he took care to have them ſent to <hi>Breſt,</hi> where they were to Embark with Monſieur <hi>de Lauſun,</hi> in order to be Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>My Spouſe, who was as nearly touch'd with the preſent unfortunate condition of our Land-lady, as with her own, as knowing that it was upon my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhe under-went all theſe Vexations, took a Reſolution to go without loſing any further time, to Court, and to wait on the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois.</hi> The firſt thing ſhe did, was to beg leave of him, for her ſelf and ſome of our Children which ſhe had brought along with her, to ſee me in Priſon; the next was, to repreſent to him the Caſe of our Land-Lady, and laſt of all, her own miſerable Fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She threw her ſelf at his Feet, her Face being all overbedewed with Tears, which ſo far mov'd him to Compaſſion, that he lifted her up from the Ground with his own Hands, and told her, That ſhe ſhould not thus afflict her ſelf beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that he would do what in him lay, and would diſpatch his Warrant immediately, for her to have leave to ſee her Husband; that he would likewiſe ſpeak to the King, to obtain a <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> in order to ſtop all further Proceedings againſt her Perſon or Eſtate. This was all ſhe was able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for that time; and ſhe thought it beſt, not to urge my Enlargement, but to expect a more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Opportunity for it. The Warrant to the Governour of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> to allow my Spouſe free acceſs to me, was diſpatch'd immediately, but the <hi>Superſedeas,</hi> was not iſſued till a conſiderable time after; ſo that our Land-lady was forced to pay the Inn-keepers all their Money, unleſs ſhe would have let them ſell all her Furniture almoſt for nothing, it being the Cuſtom, not to allow above eight days betwixt the Seizure and Sale of any moveable Goods. However, this old Maiden, what with Coveteouſneſs, and what with the Reſentment of the Affront, fell very ill, and died in a few days after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:65930:161"/>My Spouſe had no ſooner notice that ſhe had got leave to come and ſee me, but ſhe went to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> to addreſs her ſelf to the Governour, who had ſo much Complaiſance, as to Conduct her himſelf into my Chamber. He was not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at firſt, to ſee her there, after the Letter I had writ ſo lately to her, but after he had ſounded her a little, and thereby had been inform'd what it was that had brought her ſo unexpectedly to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> as likewiſe, that ſhe had not as yet ſpoken to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> about my Enlargement, he began to be in a little better Humour, not queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the leaſt, but that ſhe would take the ſame Bait, and be as eaſily impoſed upon as my Siſter and I had been before. For which purpoſe, he began to make uſe to her of the ſame Arguments, wherewith he had inveigled us before; which indeed had thus far the ſame effect upon her, as they had upon us, that ſhe was entirely perſwaded of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and good Inclinations towards us. But as Women are commonly very impatient, eſpecially when it touches ſo near, as the concerns of a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſo ſhe was not ſo much overcome by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, but that ſhe believed, ſhe ought to leave no Stone unturn'd for the recovery of my Liberty. With this Reſolution ſhe went again to Court, where ſhe miſſed not the leaſt Opportunity to ſpeak to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and to preſs him with Tears in her Eyes, to give me my Liberty; but with all the tender and paſſionate Expreſſions, ſhe could not move him to give her a poſitive anſwer, though he would ſometimes let fall ſome Words, which gave her ſome hopes; for he would frequently tell her, that ſhe needed not fear any thing upon my Account.</p>
               <p>After this my Spouſe return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing again to ſee me in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Baiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naux,</hi> did again Conduct her in perſon up Stairs, into my Chamber, but withal told us, That he had all the reaſon in the World to be diſſatisfied at her, becauſe ſhe had ſhew'd ſo little deference for him, and his good intentions to us, as to have made her
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65930:162"/>
Applications to the Miniſter of State in my behalf, when ſhe knew that it had been always his Advice not to do it as yet; but to expect a more ſeaſonable time. My Spouſe gave me an Account, that, as far as ſhe could gueſs, ſhe did not find the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> ſo much incenſed againſt me; but that however, it was her opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I muſt not expect to be receiv'd again into the King's Service, after I had had the misfortune of being a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> I reply'd, that I muſt endeavour to make the beſt of my preſent ill Circumſtances, provided I was but at liberty; and that if the Court ſhould hereafter not think fit to employ me, this was no argument that I had forfeited all my Reputation; becauſe I did not queſtion I had ſome Friends left ſtill in the world, who would put no leſs value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, tho' the Court did refuſe me. Upon this Mounſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> interrupting me, <hi>I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your meaning,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Sir, that in caſe you are not employed in</hi> France, <hi>you will go to ſerve Abroad.</hi> I anſwer'd him, that he did put a very ſiniſter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon what I had ſaid; which, if rightly taken, did imply nothing leſs, than what he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to infer from thence; that I deſired him to put a more favourable conſtruction upon my Words, ſince my intention was far different from what he believed; and that therefore it would be inhuman to heap Afflictions upon Afflictions, and to add to the miſery of a Perſon, who was ſufficiently unfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tunate before.</p>
               <p>He gave me for anſwer, that I would have done very well to have conſidered what I ſaid before I ſpoke, but that it was too late now for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract my words, or to imagine, that by putting what interpretation I pleas'd upon them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him out of what he had heard me ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He told me further, that he could not but confeſs, that it was no eaſie matter for a Perſon who lies under an unjuſt Proſecution, to keep his tongue within due bounds: That he himſelf was a Man ſubject to Paſſion, as well as others, and was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65930:162"/>
not inſenſible of the different Agitations which poſſeſs our Minds, when we think our ſelves injured to the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>I am apt to believe, that this laſt part of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was made with no other intention, than to entice me to utter my ſelf with the more freedom in his Preſence, not queſtioning but that I might let ſlip ſome words, which he intended to lay hold on to my diſadvantage, and to keep me the longer in Priſon. But his firſt Words which he had let fall unawares, were a ſufficient Warning to me, not to truſt him any further; and tho' he took a great deal of Pains to excuſe them as well as he could, yet all his Eloquence was not prevailing enough to make me alter my Opinion, or to judge otherwiſe, but that he would be glad of any Opportunity to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> tho' I muſt freely confeſs, that at that time I did not imagin that it was upon the ſcore of Self-intereſt, as it proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For it was not many days after, when my Spouſe being again admitted to Speak to the ſaid Miniſter, he ask'd her, Whether ſhe did not hear me make frequent mention of my Friends? Unto which ſhe reply'd, That I was deſtitute of Friends, or at leaſt of ſuch Friends, as to put any confidence in them; that the only reliance I had was upon my innocence, and upon his Protection. He anſwer'd her coldly, that ſhe either did not deal ſincerely with him, or elſe that I did not make her Privy to all my Concerns: That he had it from good hands, I had more and better Friends than ſhe imagined, and that conſidering the Condition I was in at preſent, this could not but be an extraordinary comfort to me, which ought to abate much of my Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>After I had a little leiſure to ponder upon what my Spouſe had told me, I had no great occaſion to conſult the Stars to gueſs from whence this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe came, the very Expreſſions made uſe of by the Miniſter, being more than ſufficient to tell me, that Mounſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> had been acting his part
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:65930:163"/>
there. I could not forbear the very firſt time I ſaw him, to give him to underſtand that I was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of his ſiniſter Intentions, and I gave a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Caution to my Spouſe, to be very careful, for the future, not to Speak any thing of moment in his Preſence; and for fear ſhe might perhaps mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake my true meaning, I writ a Letter to her, which I convey'd to the Duke <hi>de la Force,</hi> who being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſited by the Marchioneſs of <hi>Courteaumer,</hi> his Daughter, had opportunity enough of ſending it to her. For it is to be obſerv'd, that tho' my Spouſe had obtained Leave to ſee me in Priſon, yet this being not granted but in the preſence of one of the Officers belonging to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> I had no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſpeaking much to her in private; there was alſo another inconveniency, which was, that tho' ſhe had been for a conſiderable time in <hi>France,</hi> ſhe was ſo ill verſed in the French Tongue, that ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſtook one thing for another. To be ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> in the matter, the Warrant, by vertue of which ſhe was admitted to ſee me, was very different from what had been allowed to my Siſter, who had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſee me without being obliged to admit of any Witneſſes of our Diſcourſe: But the Warrant gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for my Spouſe's admiſſion was thus limited, as told you before; at leaſt, if I may believe what Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> told me; for, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, but that both the Warrants might be alike and that Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> made only uſe of this Protect to have the opportunity of keeping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

be preſent at our Converſation, under pretext of waiting on her, not ſo much purſuant to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of his Warrant, as to obſerve his own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and it cannot but appear highly improbable to me, that the Marquiſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> ſhould have gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more to my Siſter than to my Wife, the firſt of which being, purſuant to his Warrant, permitted to ſee me without any Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps be objected, that if this had been Monſieur <hi>de Baiſneaux</hi>'s intention, he might under the ſame pretext of Conducting my Siſter up ſtairs, have prevented our Converſation in private; but to this I anſwer, that I have all the reaſon in the world to imagine, that Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> who is a Man of great Senſe, did ſoon diſcover with what indifferency my Siſter acted in my behalf, her aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to me having been always ſuch, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible not to be perceived by a quick-ſighted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it was queſtionleſs this, that encouraged him to talk with her, to try whether he could bring her over to his Intereſt, which he effected at laſt to ſo good a purpoſe, that ſhe did not make one ſtep in my Buſineſs without his particular Directions. Their Correſpondence was not carried on ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but that even Mounſieur <hi>de Garenne</hi> took notice of it; for as they were talking one day about me, and my preſent unfortunate Circumſtances, in the preſence of my Siſter, he did not ſtick to tell her that, if he had ſuch a Siſter as ſhe, he would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw her in the fire.</p>

               <p>Before we parted, ſhe gave me an Account, how the Councellor <hi>des Iſles</hi> had been Condemned to a perpetual Baniſhment; but had found means to buy it off for a good Sum of Money, by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

               <p>THE continual Vexation occaſioned by the conſideration of my preſent unfortunate Circumſtances, and of the Injuſtice done me; and the little Inclination I found in my ſelf to make an intire Reſignation of my Perſon to God's pleaſure, by whoſe aſſiſtance alone, we are enabled to bear the weight of ſo heavy a Burden, as the Affliction of ſuch an unfortunate Lodging muſt needs be to a Man of my Temper; this continual Vexation I ſay, had ſuch an influence upon my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as that firſt of all, I loſt my Appetite, and ſoon after was ſeized with the Yellow Jaundice. This occaſioned ſometime after a Dropſical Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which ſo encreaſed by degrees, as that in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after, I was ſwelled to ſuch a bigneſs, as ſcarceto
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65930:166"/>
be able to go through the Door, though naturally I am very ſlender and lean. In this condition I was fain to have recourſe to a Phyſician, and a certain old Doctor was ſent to viſit me, one, who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been put in the place of Dr. <hi>Aliot,</hi> a Man as skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his Art, as this was Ignorant; but <hi>Aliot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon of honeſt Principles, and of a great deal of good Nature, would ſometimes intercede with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> in behalf of ſome Priſoners, which being directly contrary to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Governour, he found means to out him of his Place.</p>
               <p>This Phyſician was of Opinion, that I could not eſcape with Life, which made the others ask me, whether I would not have a Father Confeſſor to come to me. But finding my ſelf in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as not to be likely to improve much by his Advice, I delay'd ſending for him, for a whole Week. I ſpent moſt of this time in ruminating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Misfortune, and how unjuſtly I was Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> which raiſed my paſſion at laſt to that pitch, that one day, when my Phyſician came to viſit me, I Summon'd the ſaid Marqueſs to appear before the Tribunal of God, at the time of my Death, there to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Injuſtice he had done me. Having done this, I found my ſelf ſomewhat more at eaſe, as believing I had done one of the fineſt things in the World; ſo blind is Mankind, when God pleaſes to withdraw the light of his Grace from us. At laſt my Diſtemper increaſing every day, I thought it beſt to ſend for a Father Confeſſor; but was not a little ſurpriz'd at his words, when he told me, that conſidering my preſent Condition, he ought not to impart me Abſolution; and that therefore I muſt reſolve to retract what I had done lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Marqueſs of <hi>Louvois,</hi> by citing him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's Tribunal; becauſe it was God's Will that we ſhould forgive our Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we expect a Pardon for our Sins from him; and that unleſs I would follow his Advice, and that from the very
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65930:166"/>
bottom of my Heart, in this point, I muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the leaſt upon God Almighty's Mercy. I was ſo much exaſperated againſt the Marqueſs, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſpeak truth, my mind was yet ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from thoſe Holy Motions which bring us to the true knowledge of God's Will, that let him ſay what he would, I was reſolved to run the riſque of it, and ſo I told him in plain Terms, that it was impoſſible for me to do it. He was not ſparing in his Exhortations and Arguments, in hopes to bring me to a better Temper, but finding all his Labour loſt, he went away without giving me Abſolution. But God, whoſe Providence is beyond the reach of Men, was not willing to caſt off a loſt Sheep, but as I have great reaſon to believe ſince, ſent me this Affliction to recal me from my former Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and reſtored me to Health, contrary to the Opinion of my Phyſician, and Monſieur <hi>de Baiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naux</hi> himſelf, who did not believe any otherwiſe, but that by my Death, (which he expected every day,) he ſhould loſe the advantage of the Penſion which the King allow'd him for my Maintenance.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was recovering and gathered more and more ſtrength every day, I ſpent moſt of my time, in making ſerious Reflections upon my paſt Illneſs, and how to fortifie my Mind for the future againſt ſuch violent Reſolutions, but with no great Succeſs. About that time the Battle of <hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urus</hi> was fought in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where it pleaſed God Almighty to bleſs the King's Arms with Victory. A great number of the Enemies being taken Priſoners, they were brought to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and to make room for them, thoſe Priſoners that had been there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were removed to other Places, to make room for thoſe. They were diſperſed in ſeveral Priſons thereabouts, and among the reſt, there were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſent to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> that there was not a Tower there but what was full of Priſoners; and conſequently, I had three more Chamber-Fellows lodged in my Room, which was very large. One of them was a Councellor, whoſe Name was <hi>Mallet,</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:65930:167"/>
a very rich Man; his Crime was, that there had been ſeveral Meetings of the Proteſtants at his Houſe, where they uſed to Preach, and ſerve God, perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the Rules of the Proteſtant Religion, after he had made Abjuration of the ſame. The ſecond was called <hi>Dourlans,</hi> he was born in the City of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and was ſent to Priſon, becauſe he was accuſed of being acceſſary to a Crime committed by a certain Canon of that City, which brought him to a fatal end, of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſay more hereafter. The third, whoſe Name was <hi>Ras,</hi> was a Native of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and by his Profeſſion, a Phyſician. His Crime was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a more hainous nature than that for which the Canon ſuffered, but he had the good Fortune, to come off at a cheaper rate. He was accuſed of having made a compact with the Devil, by which means he had Debauched ſeveral Women, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many other enormous Crimes of that nature, too many to be mentioned here. Upon Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he could not deny before the Judge, (which he alſo owned to me in private) that he had made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Women miſcarry. He alſo Forged, or cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Forged, certain Letters Patents of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Chancery, by vertue of which, he was qualified to exerciſe the Profeſſion of a Chymical Phyſician; the Practice of Chymiſtry being not allowed to any body, but ſuch as have obtained a Grant for it from the King. There were three more who had been Accomplices in all his Crimes, except in that of Forging the Letters Patents. One was a Lieutenant of a Ship, the other two were called <hi>Mire</hi> and <hi>Suart,</hi> who had paid with their Lives for it. But this Phyſician made good the old Proverb, that <hi>The Gallows are built not ſo much for thoſe that are moſt Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as for thoſe that are moſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate.</hi> For he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Couſin who was Gentleman of the Horſe to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> his Intereſt prevailed ſo far in his behalf, that he was not Executed with the reſt, though they both at their Tryal, and at their Execution, did conſtantly aver that he was the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65930:167"/>
chief Contriver of moſt of thoſe Villainies, and an Accomplice in all they had committed, and for which they ſuffered. But notwithſtanding their Accuſation, and ſeveral other Proofs againſt him, he had the good luck to eſcape, and was ſent from the ordinary Priſon to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> which is always look'd upon as a good Omen in ſuch a caſe, towards the obtaining of a Pardon; and it happens fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that after they have let them undergo a ſufficient Penance by ſome years Impriſonment, they are afterwards ſet at Liberty.</p>
               <p>He ſtaid within the ſame Chamber for ſome time, and had a ſevere falling out with <hi>Mallet</hi> before his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, occaſioned by the Roguery of my <hi>Valet du Chamber,</hi> who being an arch Wag, had almoſt made <hi>Mallet</hi> run Diſtracted. Nay, he acted his part ſo to the life, and carried his Roguiſh Pranks on to that height, that he put the whole <hi>Baſtile</hi> in an uproar, not excepting the Governour himſelf. I muſt own this Fellow was the only Comfort I had left me in this diſmal Priſon, becauſe he would now and then play ſome of his mad pranks, which made me often laugh, when elſe I had no great Inclination to it. Not but that he ſometimes had alſo his Melancholy Fits, as all Priſoners have at one time or other, without exception. But his facetious Temper had ſuch an Aſcendant over them, that for the moſt part, he was as merry and brisk as if he had been at a Wedding, or any other pleaſant Paſtime. <hi>Villeroy</hi> was a Perſon much of the ſame Temper, which made him frequently divert himſelf with my <hi>Valet,</hi> and they were become ſo familiar together, that he uſed to play him ſeveral little Tricks. My <hi>Valet</hi> being reſolved once for all to be even with him, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard him talk often of a certain Miſtriſs of his, whom he reſpected much, and from whom he had ſome Letters, which he preſerved with a great deal of care, found means however, to get one of them, and was ſo induſtrious in Counterfeiting her Hand, that you would have ſworn it was the ſame, with
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:65930:168"/>
no other purpoſe, than to put his Roguery upon <hi>Villeroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt he was only watching an Opportunity to put his deſign in Execution, <hi>Villeroy,</hi> whoſe Thoughts were much taken up with his Miſtriſs, fell one Night a raving in his Sleep about her, whom he dream'd to be dead, and told us his Dream (which was the occaſion of his being thus diſturbed in his Sleep) the next day my arch Rogue was near enough to underſtand every word he ſaid, but for fear of being ſuſpected, he pretended to be buſie about ſomething or other, as if he did not mind our Diſcourſe. The next following Night he faſtned a ſmall Cord to the lower end of the Quilt of his Bed, and watch'd the Opportunity when he found <hi>Villeroy</hi> to be awake, and ſo gently, and by degrees pull'd the ſaid Quilt from <hi>Villeroy. Villeroy</hi> finding himſelf uncovered, roſe up in Bed to ſee what could be the matter, but not perceiving any thing, he was pulling the Quilt up again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but whilſt he held at one end, my Servant took care to draw it back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the ſame time, which together with the Dream he had had ſometime before, put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him into ſuch a fright, that he began to cry out aloud, and to call to me and my Servant for help. You muſt know, that my <hi>Valet</hi> had given me to underſtand before-hand, what prank he intended to play him, and it was accordingly agreed among us, that when <hi>Villeroy</hi> ſhould call out for help, he ſhould be the firſt that ſhould anſwer him. Purſuant to this Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ask'd him what was the matter, and what he would have with him? And I feigning my ſelf to be half aſleep, ask'd him immediately after, what he wanted? <hi>Villeroy</hi> perceiving that we were both in Bed, was ten times more afrighted than before; for being ſenſible that <hi>Mallet Dourlans</hi> and <hi>Ras,</hi> our three Chamber-Fellows, who had been there not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three days, would ſcarce dare to be ſo bold as to pretend to put a trick upon him, and that they ſlept all three ſo heartily, that he could plainly hear them ſnore, he could not but imagine it was ſome
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65930:168"/>
Spirit or other; ſo that without any further Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the matter, he frankly told us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how his Quilt had been drawn from him ſeveral times. He then rehearſed to us his Dream about his Miſtriſs's Death, adding, that he was now convinced, it was too too true, it being no body elſe but her, that did now come to Torment him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ras</hi> continued all this while faſt aſleep, ſo that you might hear him ſnore all over the Room, but <hi>Dourlans</hi> and <hi>Mallet</hi> being awakened in the mean while, and hearing <hi>Villeroy</hi> tell his Story with ſo much earneſtneſs, <hi>Mallet</hi> told him, he had beſt not not trouble his Head with ſuch fantaſtical Notions, becauſe the Dead never uſed to riſe out of their Graves; and that it was nothing but the ſtrength of his Imagination, which, whilſt he was half a ſleep, made him fancy ſuch ſtrange things. <hi>Villeroy</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him, that he was one who never had given much credit to Viſions, but that he was ſure, what he had told them juſt now, was nothing but truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible that he was not aſleep when the Quilt was pull'd away from him, for ſeveral times together, becauſe his Eyes were as open, and he as broad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, as he was at this moment now he ſpoke with them. <hi>Dourlans,</hi> was a very Religious Fellow, and therefore took <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s part, telling <hi>Mallet,</hi> that it was a certain ſign, he was an incorrigible Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, which made him talk at that extravagant rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe that all thoſe of his Perſwaſion did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Purgatory, but that whatever they might pretend to, he was ſure there was one, and that the Dead would ſometimes appear again among us. I thought it the beſt way to joyn with <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Dourlans,</hi> and ſo gave my Judgment on their ſide. But my unlucky <hi>Valet,</hi> who was reſolved not to ſpoil the ſport, went further than all the reſt; for he had a Story ready at hand, which he related to us in a very grave tone, and which he avowed to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to his own Mother, to convince us, that there was certainly ſuch a thing as Apparitions. <hi>Mallet</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perſiſted in his former Opinion againſt it, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65930:169"/>
furniſhed us with ſuch variety of Arguments to prove the vanity of ours, that we ſpent the greateſt part of the Night in arguing the caſe among us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Ras,</hi> who did not ſtir, though we talk'd very loud all the while.</p>
               <p>Being tired, at laſt we all went to Bed again. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Two hours before day-light, my <hi>Valet</hi> took this Opportunity to unlooſe the String where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had pulled the Quilt, and ſo to ſleep he went, as if he had had no Finger in the Pye. The next Morning we were no ſooner got out of Bed, but we begun to reaſſume the former Theme, and to argue upon what it could be that had happened to <hi>Villeroy</hi> the laſt Night. <hi>Ras</hi> was the only Perſon who ſaid little to the matter, becauſe he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, which made us ask him, how it could be poſſible for him to ſleep all the while when we made ſuch a noiſe and clamour enough to have put the whole <hi>Baſtile</hi> in an Alarm; which he anſwered only with a ſmile. Towards Evening, <hi>Villeroy</hi> being ſorely afraid of another viſit from his Ghoſt, deſired me by all means to let my <hi>Valet</hi> put his Bed cloſe to the Feet of his. This was Nuts for this unlucky Baſtard, who being now ſo near to him, had the better opportunity to Torment him in the ſame manner, at his own leiſure. And poor <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who had his Head and his Heart full of his Spirit, did talk of nothing elſe every day, but how he was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented every Night. <hi>Mallet</hi> perſiſted immoveable in his Opinion, that it was nothing but a Fancy, and we contradicted him as often. At laſt my <hi>Valet</hi> being reſolved to ſtrike the Nail up to the head, and to try how far it would go, told us one day very ſeriouſly, that he remembred very well, that when his Mother was afflicted with a Spirit in the ſame manner as <hi>Villeroy</hi> was now, advice was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her by a very Learned Perſon, to lay a piece of fine white Paper upon the Table, which ſhe having done accordingly, ſhe had found the next Morning ſomething writ upon the ſaid Paper, by which the Spirit gave her inſtructions how to behave her ſelf,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65930:169"/>
and what ſhe was to do, to deliver her ſelf from the Spirit that Tormented her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mallet</hi> went on in his old Tune, and ſaid it was an Old Womans ſtory; but <hi>Villeroy</hi> lik'd it ſo well, that he reſolved to try it the very next Night. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he took half a Sheet of fine white Paper, neatly cut, (of which my Wife had brought us ſome Quires) this he laid upon the Table, juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was going to bed, at which <hi>Mallet</hi> could not forbear to laugh heartily. My <hi>Valet,</hi> who obſerved every thing that paſs'd, took the firſt opportunity, as ſoon as we were all gone to Bed, to take away that half Sheet of Paper, and in lieu of it, laid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame Bigneſs, Subſtance, and Fineneſs, which he had taken out of my Parcel (which was the very ſame Paper) upon which he had before-hand Written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> theſe following Words; <hi>Repent, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of your Sins commited in ſuch and ſuch a place, and let Prayers be offered for me to God Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he did as ſoon as the Candle was put out, and ſo to bed he went, where he lay watching till <hi>Villeroy</hi> was faln aſleep. Then he began to play his old Game with pulling the Quilt, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the poor Gentlemen to that degree, that being awakened he cry'd out for a Candle. My <hi>Valet</hi> did at firſt as if he did not hear him; but being forced to riſe by his repeated exclamations, fell a grumbling, becauſe he made him riſe at that time of the Night.</p>
               <p>The Candle was no ſooner Lighted, but <hi>Villeroy</hi> got out of the Bed, and in a trembling Poſture went towards the Table, to ſee whether there was any News from his ſuppoſed dead Miſtreſs. As ſoon as he perceived the Writing, he call'd to me to be an Eye Witneſs, of what he thought could be no leſs than a Miracle. It was pleaſant enough to ſee him tremble at the very ſight of it, and quake for fear as he took it up, and his ſurpriſe was paſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, when he read the Contents of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mallet</hi> continued all this while in the ſame hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and would not as much as have riſen out of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65930:170"/>
his Bed, to be a ſpectator of the Miracle, if <hi>Dourlans, Ras, Villeroy,</hi> and I had not conſtrained him to it; for we told him, that, if he would not riſe upon his own accord, we would draw his Bed from under him, and lay him upon the ground. As he look'd upon the Writing, we did not obſerve the leaſt change in his Countenance, which made us believe that he did not put the leaſt faith in it. <hi>Dourlans</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> were ſo far prepoſſeſs'd with an Opinion of this miracle, that they curſed him bitterly, but I, and my Servant, had not ſo much reaſon to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him; and as for <hi>Ras,</hi> he ſhew'd ſo much indifferency in the matter, that it was no eaſy matter to gueſs at his Thoughts. We were ſo curious, as to compare the Hand-writing of this Paper with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters which <hi>Villeroy</hi> kept by him, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his dearly beloved Miſtriſs, and the one was ſo like the other, that there was not any body there who could find out the leaſt difference. I was ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to put them in mind, that they ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo compare the Paper with the reſt that <hi>Villeroy</hi> had, to ſee whether it were exactly the ſame, which being done accordingly, was found likewiſe to be the very ſame, and well it might be ſo, for my Spouſe had given both him and me of the ſame Paper.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to be imagin'd, that the night-time was the moſt proper to cover ſuch a Deceit, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might not have paſs'd ſo well by day as by Candle-light. My roguiſh <hi>Valet</hi> being ſenſible of this, and ſorely affraid leſt he ſhould be diſcover'd the next day, found means to take this Paper out of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi>'s pocket, after he was gone to Bed again. This furniſh'd new matter of Surprize the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for when <hi>Villeroy</hi> was going to read it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and found it not, he was more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in his former Opinion. <hi>Mallet</hi> took this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to upbraid <hi>Dourlans</hi> and me with too much credulity, telling us, in plain Terms, that <hi>Villeroy</hi> play'd the fool with us, and that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to impoſe upon us, he had choſen the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65930:170"/>
as more ſuitable to his purpoſe, becauſe he knew that day-light would ſoon have diſcover'd the Deceit. <hi>Villeroy</hi> was ſo horribly mad at him, that we had all enough to do to keep him from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foul upon him, and continued ſo ſtedfaſt in his Opinion, that he reſolved to perform every thing to the greateſt nicety, what his ſuppoſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Miſtriſs had commanded him in her Paper: He ſent Money to his Confeſſor to ſay Maſſes for her Soul; and did not neglect the leaſt thing that is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done upon ſuch like Occaſions. My <hi>Valet</hi> thinking it now high time to leave him at reſt, began to play his pranks with <hi>Mallet.</hi>

               <p>You muſt know that we were allowed Needle and Thread, to mend our Cloaths, and other things. He took four doubled Threads, which he twiſted in the Nature of a Pack-thread, and by the help of a large Needle, faſtned to the lower end of his Quilt, whilſt the other was a Sleep. This Thread being about Twelve or Fourteen Yards long, he took both ends of it in his hands, and ſo pull'd the Quilt from him, who finding himſelf uncovered, pull'd it up again, to cover himſelf: The Valet was very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give way as often as he found <hi>Mallet</hi> to draw the Quilt upwards, but was as nimble in pulling of it backwards, as ſoon as he found the other to let go his hold, which made the other ſtark Mad.</p>
               <p>At firſt he imagin'd, that the thing happened by accident, or by his turning in Bed, but being at laſt convinced to the contrary, by the frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of the ſame Game, he did not know what to make of it, and at laſt began to imagine that ſome body or other play'd the fool with him, in the ſame manner as he believed had been done with <hi>Villeroy.</hi> This made him get out of Bed, and he ſearched all round it to ſee whether he could find out the trick, but my Servant was too quick for him, for ſo ſoon as he heard him get out of Bed, he let go one end of the Thread, and ſo drew it out of the Quilt by the other end, ſo that <hi>Mallet</hi> was fain to go to Bed again without being able to Diſcover the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65930:171"/>
Truth of the matter. I happened to be awake whilſt he was thus ſearching about, and had enough to do to keep my ſelf from burſting out into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without ſaying one word, becauſe I ſuppoſed, he would have ſpoken to me firſt: But I am apt to believe, he was aſham'd to own his concern, for fear we ſhould laugh at him now, as he had laugh'd at us before; and ſo to Bed he went again, without ſaying one word, or taking one Minutes reſt more that night.</p>
               <p>The next morning he took <hi>Villeroy</hi> and me into one corner of the Room, and without mentioning the leaſt what had happened to him the laſt night, he told us, that ſince he had more ſeriouſly weighed the matter, he was of opinion, that it was that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſh fellow <hi>Ras,</hi> who had thus tormented <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who being a Magician, had queſtionleſs call'd the Devil to his Aid, to make diſturbance in our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; he added further, that if we would follow his advice, we ought altogether to Petition the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Monſieur <hi>Baiſenaux,</hi> to remove him from ours into another Room. But <hi>Villeroy</hi> being prepoſſeſs'd with an opinion, that it was his beloved Miſtreſſes Spirit, and not the Devil, that had thus tormented him, did make no great account of what he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us; and I for my part, did not ſay much to the matter it being ſufficient for me, to underſtand, that his laſt Nights adventure began to make him uneaſie.</p>
               <p>But though he met with no great Encouragement on our ſide, yet he was reſolved to let the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour know of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which reaſon he ſpoke to the Turn Key<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſiring him to give notice of it to Monſieur <hi>Baiſenaux.</hi> It is to be obſerved, that the Governour had been ſeveral times to ſee us whilſt poor <hi>Villeroy</hi> was thus Tormented by my unlucky Rogue; but as he was a Perſon not over Credulous, and that he had but an indifferent Opinion of <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi>'s parts, he had been careleſs in the matter; but when he heard <hi>Millet</hi> touch upon the ſame String, he did not know what to make of it; for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>Mallet</hi> to be a Man of Senſe, and who was not eaſily to be impoſed upon; beſides that, he was a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> who ſeldom make any great account of things of this nature, and yet hearing him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a Spirit, he began to reflect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more ſeriouſly upon it, than if another had talk'd to him of Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Monſieur <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> the next time he came to pay us a Viſit, addreſs'd himſelf with a ſmile to <hi>Mallet,</hi> and ask'd him in his Country Tone, (for being a Native of <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> he had not yet loſt his Country Tone, though he had been many years at Court, and in <hi>Paris</hi>) whether he were afraid of Spirits as well as the reſt? <hi>Mallet</hi> was aſham'd to be thus hit to the quick by the Governour, and not knowing what Anſwer to make, he fell at laſt upon poor <hi>Ras,</hi> and told him, it was that Deviliſh Fellow, who had the Evil Spirits at his Command, and had brought them among them on purpoſe to torment them; though it be certain, that poor <hi>Ras</hi> had not the leaſt ſhare in it; for he was ſince his Impriſonment, much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what he had been before; God Almighty having ſhew'd him ſo much Mercy as to make him truly Repenting of his former ill Courſes; and he told me very ſeriouſly one day, that he was ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that time of the hainouſneſs of his Crimes, that he wiſh'd he had Suffered with the reſt, to make an Aton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Conſidering his preſent Condition, he had no other Plea againſt what he was Accuſed of by <hi>Mallet,</hi> but this, that he knew himſelf to be a great Sinner, yet he hoped not to continue ſo all his Life-time, which he would frequently repeat with Tears in his Eyes, both to us and the Governour.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> having thorowly Examin'd all the Circumſtances of the matter, did at laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with <hi>Mallet</hi> and <hi>Villeroy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:65930:172"/>
upon by his Priſoners in ſuch a point as this, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to proceed with all the Caution imaginable. For which purpoſe, he ordered one of the Turn-Keys, whoſe Name was <hi>St. John,</hi> to lie in the ſame Chamber with us. This Turn-Key being the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's Country-man, of whoſe ability he had a more than ordinary Conceit, he thought it next to an impoſſibility, to have a Trick put upon him. But my unlucky Rogue made a Fool of him as well as of the reſt; for he play'd the ſame Game with him that he had done with <hi>Mallet,</hi> which put the Turn-Key into ſuch a Fright, that he was glad to get out of the Chamber, and gave an Account to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, that all what they had told him, was no more than what was really true; ſo that the whole being now put beyond all queſtion, it was the chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the whole <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where you could hear them talk for ſometime of nothing elſe, but of the Spirits that haunted our Chamber.</p>
               <p>Among the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it came alſo to the Duke <hi>de la Force</hi>'s Ears, who writ me a Letter on purpoſe to know the whole matter. I confirm'd him in his Opinion, as I had done ſeveral others before as imagining it to be no point of Honour, to impoſe upon a Man's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity in a thing of this nature. Monſieur <hi>de Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowis,</hi> Treaſurer of the States of <hi>Britainy,</hi> who was alſo at that time a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and Din'd every day with the Duke <hi>de la Force,</hi> told the Story to his Son, who had got leave to ſee him. He being a Councellor of the Parliament, told it further to his Brethren, ſo that it was ſpread all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Paris,</hi> where it paſſed current, as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs my <hi>Valet</hi> would not part thus with <hi>Mallet,</hi> but was a continual plague to him; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would draw open the Curtains of his Bed, ſometimes pull his Quilt, ſometimes play him ſome other miſchievous Tricks, ſo that the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being almoſt out of his Wits, and imagining no otherwiſe, but that <hi>Ras</hi> was the ſole Cauſe of it, he would beſtow many bitter Curſes upon him.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:65930:172"/>
He was at laſt ſo vehemently Exaſperated againſt him, that he would no longer Eat or Drink with him, and he ſent word to the Governour, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he did remove him into another Chamber, no good would come of it; we did what we could to cure him of this Fancy, but in vain; ſo that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> was forced to put <hi>Ras</hi> into another Room.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Valet</hi> would then have put a period to his Roguery, the better to perſwade <hi>Mallet,</hi> that <hi>Ras</hi> had been the only occaſion of what had happened to him hitherto; but I would needs make him go on for ſome time longer, being willing to ſave in ſome meaſure, this poor Fellow's Reputation, which was afreſh (though falſely) impaired by my Servant's means. Thus he was reſolved to put an Epilogue to the Play, which, in outward appearance was very bloody, and which put <hi>Mallet</hi> into ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, that he did not know which way to turn himſelf next.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then, that this Servant of mine had been formerly an Actor upon the Stage, by which means he had learned ſo many unlucky Tricks, and among the reſt, had a certain Powder by him, which being mixed with fair Water only, made it look like Blood; a thing much in uſe among thoſe who act Drolls. Of this he mixed a certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a Bottle of fair Water, and as he was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mallet</hi>'s Bed, (which he was uſed to do every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day) he found means to ſpill this Bottle with the Bloody Water in it. <hi>Mallet,</hi> as he was lying down, finding his Sheets all wet, called for a Candle to ſee what the matter was; you may gueſs how great was his Surprize, when he ſaw them all over bloody, for by the colour he ſuppoſed it was ſuch. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us all to him to be Eye Witneſſes of what had happened to him, the fault of which he again laid at <hi>Ras</hi>'s Door; ſo that in lieu of ſucceeding in my Deſign, which was to Juſtifie <hi>Ras, Mallet</hi> conceived a worſe Opinion of him than ever, ſo true it is,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65930:173"/>
that the Succeſs is not always anſwerable to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
               <p>But it is now time to return to what I promiſed you before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> To give you an Account of the Buſineſs of the Canon before mentioned. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a noted Man in the City of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> as being the eldeſt Judge of the Court of Judicature there; and his Son, the Canon, had lived for ſome years in good Reputation, till at laſt being fallen in Love with a young Lady of the ſame City, and their Amorous Intrigues diſcovered, and come to the Ears of ſome of the reſt of the Capitulars, they took a Reſolution to call him to an Account about it. They had carried on their matters ſo indiſcreetly, that it being noiſed all about the Town, he was ſenſible he ſhould not be able to abide a Tryal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judged it moſt for his purpoſe, to ſell his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonſhip; conſidering eſpecially, that his Brethren had already taken this Opportunity to put him out of his Employment of being Sollicitor of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which made him take a fatal reſolution to be revenged at any rate upon ſome of the Canons whom he knew to be moſt his Enemies: He writ a Letter in Cyphers contriv'd as if written by him who was the Head of theſe Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this he carried to <hi>Dourlans,</hi> who uſed to engroſs all his Writings, whilſt he was Sollicitor of the Chapter, and deſired him to write it in fair Characters, becauſe it was to be ſent to a Relation of the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> who was ſent upon ſome ſecret Errand into <hi>Germany. Dourlans,</hi> who indeed knew that the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> had ſuch a Gentleman (who was his Relation) belonging to him, and that he was ſent abroad, did without further informing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the matter what the Canon deſired of him.</p>
               <p>The Letter writ in Cyphers was directed to a certain Bookſellor in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> who, as he told <hi>Dourlans,</hi> knew his Hand, and was further to diſpatch theſe Letters, according to direction. They contained in ſubſtance, That the Perſon, whoſe Name was under-written, deſired the ſaid Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65930:173"/>
to ſend him, and three or four more of his Friends (whom he named) each ſome Treatiſes, writ in Defence of <hi>Janſeniſm,</hi> and to direct them to a certain Bookſeller at <hi>Beauvais,</hi> (whoſe Name he alſo ſent him) promiſing, that he would diſperſe a great many of theſe Copies, becauſe this Sect was far from being ſuppreſs'd in <hi>France;</hi> though they labour'd under very violent Perſecutions; (adding withal, that thoſe who adhered ſtill to it, could not but heartily wiſh and ſigh after the ſame happineſs which the Inhabitants of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> enjoy'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Prince, who ſuffered no Perſecution in thoſe Provinces, whereas in <hi>France</hi> many Devout and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Perſons were Baniſhed their Native Country, and reduced to the utmoſt Extremity, for no other reaſon, but becauſe they could not conſent to what was againſt their real Opinion.</p>
               <p>This Canon's deſign was to carry this Letter to the Cardinal <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> by which means he did not queſtion to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon thoſe Canons, who had acted againſt him, by having them Baniſh'd the Kingdom; not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, but that if thereby they could but become ſuſpected of being Favourers of the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> they would undergo the ſame fate which two others of their Fraternity, one of whom had been Baniſhed to <hi>Loches,</hi> the other to <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>impercorentin,</hi> becauſe they were only ſuſpected of adhering to that Sect.</p>
               <p>The better to cover his deſign, he writ alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter, which he ſent to the Poſt, directed to one of his Friends, but in two hours came to fetch it back, under pretence that he had forgot to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſomething which was of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to him. After he had done this, he went to wait on the Cardinal <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> whom he told, that having occaſion to go to the Poſt-Houſe in Perſon, to fetch back a Letter of his which he had ſent thither before, becauſe he had forgot ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which muſt needs be put in before it was ſent to his Friend, and looking among the Letters, he had met with one which being Sealed up with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65930:174"/>
the Seal of the Chapter, he could not forbear to put it in his Pocket<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though at the ſame time he felt a ſecret Check of Conſcience within himſelf, as being ſenſible that we ought to put a more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Conſtruction upon our Neighbours Actions; but that as the thing happened, he had no reaſon now to repent of his curioſity; for that after he had broke it open, he had found it written in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which he looking upon as an evident mark that there was ſome Myſtery in it, he had thought it his Duty to bring it to him, as knowing, that the Cogniſance of thoſe matters belonging to the Chapter, was within the Limits of his Juriſdiction. Then he preſented to him the before mentioned Letter, without the cover, which he had torn to pieces, for fear the Character of the Hand might perhaps have been known to ſome of the Cardinal's People. The Cardinal ask'd him immediately what was become of the Cover, becauſe he had a mind to ſee the Direction; but he readily anſwered him, that having forgot to leave it upon his Table at Home, he ſuppoſed ſome body or other had taken it up for waſte Paper; but that he had taken particular notice of the Superſcription, which was directed to a certain Perſon, (whom he named) <hi>Bookſeller</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and that indeed this had been the chief Motive which induced him to lay hold of the Letter.</p>
               <p>But before I go further, I will tell you in two Words how he got clear of the Accuſation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency; for before he contrived this Letter, he found out a certain Perſon of his Acquaintance, who in conſideration of a good Sum of Money, Marry'd the young Woman who was his Miſtriſs, and declared himſelf to be father of the Child; thus thinking himſelf free from all further Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he got again into the poſſeſſion of his Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and exercis'd his Function, as if no body had any'thing to ſay againſt him.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Cardinal <hi>de Fourbin;</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this Letter to the King, who, after its being
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65930:174"/>
Decypher'd, order'd the Canons and the Bookſeller of <hi>Beauvais</hi> to be taken up, and to be carried to Priſon at <hi>Vincennes,</hi> and that Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne</hi> ſhould Examine them, and prepare Matters for their Tryal. Our Canon, their Enemy, when he ſaw their Life to be in danger, began to repent of what he had done, not imagining it would come to that; but as God would have it, he had been ſo careleſs, as to inſert ſome Matters which amounted to no leſs than a Capital Crime. After Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne</hi> had Examined the Priſoners, he was ſoon convinced of their innocence, and having made his Report accordingly to his Majeſty; he ask'd the Cardinal <hi>de Fourbin,</hi> how he could be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen as to be thus impoſed upon? The Cardinal being then obliged to give the King an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how it happened, his Majeſty was ſufficiently ſenſible that they were innocent, and ordered the Canon who had thus falſly accuſed them, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Cuſtody. But he who did not like the Buſineſs, did not think fit to ſtay long at <hi>Beauvais,</hi> but was gone to <hi>Paris,</hi> to diſpoſe once more of his Canonſhip to the ſame Perſon he had ſold it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with an intention, ſo ſoon as he had got the Money, to retire to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and to turn Heretick; this being the Reward the Devil commonly beſtows upon thoſe who are guided by him, eſpecially if they are Perſons who have devoted themſelves to God, and are conſequently obliged to ſhew good Examples to others.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Fourbin</hi> being inform'd, that he was not at <hi>Beauvais,</hi> had ſearch made after him all over <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was at laſt found out, that very day as he was going to leave it, in order to go to <hi>Geneva.</hi> From thence he was ſent to Priſon to <hi>Vincennes,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne</hi> would have confronted him with the other Canons, whom he had accuſed, but he ſaved him the pains, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Confeſſion of the whole matter, and ſo cleared the Canons from what he had laid to their charge. But he accuſed one <hi>Heron,</hi> who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65930:175"/>
been Regiſter of the Chapter, but had been put out of his Employment, as being ſuſpected by the Canons, that it was by his advice that this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non had got his Miſtriſs a Husband, and that the ſame was of his finding out.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Heron,</hi> I ſay, he accuſed of having been the firſt Contriver and Adviſer of what he had done, and that he had recommended <hi>Dourlans</hi> to him as a fit Perſon to write that Letter, which was the cauſe of his preſent Misfortune.</p>
               <p>A Warrant being upon this Depoſition granted to take <hi>Heron</hi> and <hi>Dourlans</hi> into Cuſtody, neither of them thought fit to abſcond. For <hi>Dourlans</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of nothing but writing the Letter, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of which were unknown to him; and <hi>Heron,</hi> whether he was guilty or not, I will not determine, but certain it is, he thought it beſt not to flie for it, being ſure, that he had enough to except againſt the Canon's Teſtimony. At the ſame time the Impriſoned Canons were ſet at liberty, and the Cardinal <hi>de Fourbin</hi> came in Perſon to fetch them out, in his own Coach, to make ſome amends for the Affront he had put upon them by his over Credulity, and to take off the ſtain which had been put upon their Reputation, and would not have been eaſie to have been taken off, if God by his peculiar Providence had not protected their Innocence, and made their Accuſer clearthem of their ſuppoſed Crime. Their ſurprize was great, when they met all four toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe each of them being taken in Cuſtody without the knowledge of the other, they were not in the leaſt ſenſible before that time of one another's Impriſonment.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal gave them an ample Account of the whole Contrivance of the matter, and ſo took them home along with him to Supper.</p>
               <p>The Canon who was guilty of the Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, being confronted with <hi>Heron,</hi> perſiſted in his former Depoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That what he had done in this caſe, was done by the advice of <hi>Heron.</hi> But <hi>Heron</hi> alledged in his Defence, That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65930:175"/>
Accuſation proceeded from a premeditated Malice, becauſe he had refuſed to lend him a Sum of Money a few days before he was taken up, which made him now endeavour to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt him by this means. To corroborate what he ſaid, he produc'd a Letter written by the ſaid Canon upon that account, and he poſitively declared, that upon his refuſal, he had told him, that he would make him repent of it. The Canon being likewiſe confronted with <hi>Dourlans,</hi> he ſpoke no more than what was true, and what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, which amounted to no more than that he had writ a Letter in Cyphers, which he did not underſtand.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were buſie in ſearching into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this Buſineſs, the Canon's Father made his Applications to ſome of his Friends, whom he knew to have great Intereſt with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> to put a ſtop to the Proceedings againſt his Son, which thus hung in ſuſpence till after the Death of this Miniſter. But whether it was that his Friends had not the ſame Intereſt with thoſe who ſucceeded the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> or whether it was at the ſollicitation of <hi>Dourlans</hi>'s Wife, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to clear her Husband, certain it is, that ſome time after, this buſineſs after it had lain dormant for ſome time, was revived all on a ſudden, and Monſieur <hi>de la Reyne</hi> received poſitive Orders from the King's own Mouth to bring it to a Tryal.</p>
               <p>The Judges being met at the <hi>Bastile,</hi> were at the greateſt Nonplus that could be, how to behave themſelves in reſpect of <hi>Heron,</hi> who ſtood upon his Innocence, whilſt the other perſiſted in his Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him. The beſt expedient they could pitch upon, was to put the Canon to the Rack, which being to be put in execution in our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we were put ſo long into another; but the Canon remaining immoveable in his former Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions againſt <hi>Heron,</hi> we all look'd upon him as a loſt Man, though at the ſametime, we were much at a loſs, what could be the reaſon of ſo rigorous a
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65930:176"/>
Proceeding for a Crime, which in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was not Capital. But however it was, the Canon was Sentenced to Death by theſe Judges. It is to be obſerved here, that they have a different way of Condemning the Criminals in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> from what is done in the Parliamentary or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts of Juſtice; for the Criminals never know their Sentence here, till they are ready to be led to Execution.</p>
               <p>The Canon being thus ignorant of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deſtiny, Dined as heartily as if he had a great while to live, and by his Appetite one would ſcarce have gueſs'd him to have been upon the Rack but the Night before, when one <hi>Berte,</hi> (who is Major of the <hi>Baſtile</hi>) came to tell him, that he was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without, in the ſame manner as if he was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Judges, or to meet with ſome of his Friends without. He was going to put on his <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> which was of a fine <hi>Bruſſels</hi> Camblet, lin'd with black Velvet; but <hi>Berte</hi> knowing what way he was to take, and thinking it more convenient for the Turn-key than for the Hang-man, told him, that he need not trouble himſelf about that, becauſe he would ſoon come back again. From thence he conducted him ſtraight ways to the Chappel of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where the condemned Criminals commonly hear the laſt Maſs, and was met there by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, the Recorder, and the Hang-man. The firſt thing the Recorder did, was to read his Sentence to him, which done, the Confeſſor began to do his Office, and to endeavour to prepare him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Death; the Hang-man ſtanding by all this while, but unknown as ſuch to the Priſoner; it being alſo a Cuſtom, which is always obſerved in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> that the Hang-man never lays Hands on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Criminal till he is going from the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the place of Execution.</p>
               <p>If it be true, what ſeveral Officers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Baſtile</hi> told us, the Father Confeſſor had received private Inſtructions to try all means with him, to perſwade him to clear <hi>Heron,</hi> who had ſix
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65930:176"/>
Children, and very good Friends, who did all what they could to ſave him. This, and the hopes of a Pardon, for which his Father made very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful Sollicitation with the King, made them ſtay in the Chappel till half an hour before Night. Nay, the Canons themſelves, whom he had ſo falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, came from <hi>Beauvais</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his Majeſty's Feet, in hopes of obtaining his Pardon, but were anſwered as well as the Father by the King, that his Crime was too black to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Pardon. Thus the laſt hour approaching, and there being no further hopes of a Pardon, he was delivered up to the Hang-man, who conducted him to the place of Execution, where after he had made an ingenuous Confeſſion of his Crime, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cleared <hi>Heron</hi> from what he had accuſed him of before, he was Hanged on a Gibbet. <hi>Heron</hi> being thus cleared from what had been laid to his charge, would queſtionleſs have been quite diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Impriſonment at the ſame time as <hi>Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> was, if the Canon's Father, who was raving mad, becauſe of the Tragical Exit of his Son, which in ſome meaſure he imputed to <hi>Heron,</hi> had not obtained a new Warrant, by vertue of which, he was to be transferred to the Priſon of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> where he was to be Try'd upon an Information of Extortion exhibited againſt him. How he came off, or whether he was as fortunate in getting out of the Priſon of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> as he was in getting out of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> I am not able to give you an account, it having been my misfortune to remain a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile</hi> ever ſince that time.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Dourlans</hi> was diſcharged, I had but two Chamber-Fellows left me, to wit, <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;</hi> and <hi>Mallet</hi> did likewiſe not ſtay long after with us, being ordered to be ſent from thence to the Priſon of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> He did leave no Stone unturned to procure his Liberty, offering to make a ſecond Abjuration of his Religion, by which means he knew ſeveral had obtained their Liberty; but the Court rejected his Offers, and ſent him word, that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65930:177"/>
whether he did or did not, it would avail him but little, ſince he had done it once already. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he was conducted to <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him ſince, I have never been able to learn.</p>
               <p>But it was not long before they provided <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> and me another Chamber-fellow, who's Name was <hi>Chapelier de Villefort,</hi> who had been a priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile</hi> for above Fifteen Years. He was a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Madam <hi>le Tellier,</hi> Mother to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> and a near Kinſman of Monſieur <hi>d'Aligre</hi> Lord High Chancellor of <hi>France;</hi> and it was happy for him, he was, for if it had not been for his great relations, who by their powerful interceſſion had ſaved him from the Gallows, he could not have been ſo long lived in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where he had been put with no other intention, than to protect him from the Proſecution of the Parliament, which had been affronted by him in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>Some time before he was Committed to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> he uſed almoſt as frequently to appear in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Apparel as in Mans Habit; this cuſtom and ſome Features of his Face, which had a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to that of a Woman, made him paſs for ſuch among a great many, who were not in the leaſt apprehenſive of his Diſguiſe. The Marquiſs <hi>de Rotelin,</hi> one of his particular Friends, and his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Companion in moſt of his Debaucheries, was acquainted with a certain Country Gentleman, who being bleſſed with a much greater ſhare of Riches and Quality, than of Wit, he pitch'd upon him as a fit object to make ſome ſport withall. For this purpoſe he entred into a Cabal with the Abbot <hi>d'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trangues,</hi> Son of the Governor of <hi>Macon,</hi> whom he knew to be likewiſe of this Country Gentleman's intimate acquaintance, and it was agreed among them, to help him to a Spouſe. Accordingly <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> told him, that he was acquainted with a Young handſome and rich Widow, and of very good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to whom he would recommend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:65930:177"/>They made the Country Gentleman's mouth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to that degree, at ſo dainty a bit, that he hug'd and kiſs'd them, begging them to aſſiſt him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing him a free acceſs to this Lady. They both told him, That they ſhould be very ready to ſerve him, but that he could not expect to be admitted to a perſon of her Quality, unleſs he firſt put himſelf in an Equipage ſuitable to his pretenſions, ſo the Country Spark bought himſelf a new Chariot with fine Horſes and Liveries, anſwerable in all reſpects to his Quality, and intentions of Courting a great Fortune, and thus Equipp'd, he was introduced to the fair Widow, who now had changed her right Name (being <hi>Chapelier de Villefort</hi>) into that of the Counteſs of <hi>Meru.</hi> He had ſcarce made three or four Viſits to her, but he found himſelf in Love over head and Ears, and thinking himſelf ſecure of her Eſtate, by what <hi>Rotelin</hi> and <hi>d'Etrangues</hi> had aſſured him upon that point, he began to puſh the matter forward, and to urge this pretended Counteſs to declare her ſelf, whether he might flatter himſelf, that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were acceptable to her.</p>
               <p>This Maſculine Counteſs, who knew how to act the part of a cunning Lady to the Life, told him at laſt with a bluſh, that ſhe being reſolved never to diſpoſe of her Perſon, without the approbation of two of her intimate Friends, (whom ſhe Named to him) he muſt make his applications to them, as well as to her ſelf, and that if he could ſo far Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon them, as to gain their conſent, it would be the only way to obtain hers. Theſe were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Boſſuet,</hi> Wife of Monſieur <hi>Boſſuet,</hi> Maſter of Requeſts; and the Marſhal <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> his Lady, who had been made Partners in the contrivance, that they might have their ſhare in the ſport they intended to make with our Country Suiter; who ſeeing himſelf thus under a neceſſity to make his Addreſſes to theſe Ladies, they acted their part ſo pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, That they not only made him their chief Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but alſo at laſt found means to eaſie his Pocket of a good Summ of Money; for ſome time
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65930:178"/>
after they told him, that they had not been wanting to make all the interceſſions they could in his behalf, which they believed might in time have a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Influence upon his Miſtreſs, but that the beſt way to make ſure of her, would be to apply himſelf likewiſe to the Counteſs <hi>de Montperoux;</hi> becauſe they were ſenſible that this Lady had ſuch an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant over the Counteſs <hi>de Meru,</hi> his ador'd Lady, That ſhe rely'd entirely upon all what ſhe ſaid or Propoſed; and that they verily believed, that if ſhe ſhould tell her at Noon day, it was Midnight, ſhe would certainly believe it.</p>
               <p>The Country Gentleman being over-joy'd, that he carry'd his point ſo far, as to have gain'd the good will of theſe two Ladies; did not queſtion, but by their Aſſiſtance, to prevail alſo upon the third; but found himſelf ſomewhat miſtaken in his gueſs; for ſhe received him with ſo much indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, that he began to be quite in deſpair of the ſucceſs of his Amour.</p>
               <p>His next Applications were made to his Friend <hi>Rotelin,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>d'Etrangues,</hi> whom he gave an ample Relation of his ill ſucceſs with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>de Montperoux:</hi> Theſe began to raiſe his drooping hopes by telling him, that moſt Ladies being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a cold Conſtitution, it was not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, if they treated Strangers at firſt with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, but that when a Man once could gain upon them, they proved afterwards the beſt Friends; that he muſt not be thus repulſed, but muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to continue his Applications ſo long, till he might find her in a more pliable Temper.</p>
               <p>Encouraged by their Advice, he makes his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes again to the Counteſs of <hi>Montperoux,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with more coldneſs than before, and at laſt told him, that ſhe wondred how he could flatter himſelf ſo far, as to imagine, that ſhe would advice her Friend the Counteſs <hi>de Meru,</hi> to Marry a perſon, who would infallibly carry her into the Country the next day after her wedding. Our Lover being put beyond all hopes by this fatal anſwer, addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65930:178"/>
once more to Madam <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> and Madam <hi>de la Boſſuet,</hi> who, purſuant to what had been concerted betwixt them before, told him, That they would not have him be quite diſmay'd at her anſwer; that they perhaps might be able, to aſſiſt him ſtill with their advice, which they hoped would ſtand him in good ſtead; and that the only way to gain the aſſiſtance of the Counteſs <hi>de Montperoux,</hi> would be to engage her into his Intereſt by a good preſent, becauſe they knew her to be in a condition, not to refuſe an offer of that kind. And to confeſs the Truth, the ſaid Counteſs was reduced to ſo low a condition at that time, that ſhe had ſcarce any thing to maintain her Family, but what ſhe was obliged for to the benevolence of ſome Ladies of Quality of her acquaintance; ſo that our Country Suiter, at the perſuaſions of theſe Ladies, was no readier to offer it, than ſhe was to accept it with both Hands.</p>
               <p>The Country Gentleman was immediately after, made ſenſible, that the Charms of his Gold had had a much more powerful influence upon the Counteſs <hi>de Montperoux,</hi> than all his Cringes; for ſhe quickly changed her Note, promiſing him to make uſe of all her Intereſt with the Counteſs <hi>de Meru,</hi> to make him happy, ſo that the young Lover finding a much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier acceſs to his Miſtreſs than before, did preſs her every day, to conſummate the Marriage. She ſeem'd at laſt to be overcome by his preſſing Inſtances, and the Articles of Marriage being drawn by Counſellours choſen on both ſides, the ſame were Sign'd by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concern'd. Whilſt our Country Lover was thus flattering himſelf with hopes of his approaching happineſs, the Counteſs <hi>de Meru,</hi> found every day ſome excuſe or other for the delaying of the Marriage, and in the end to rid her ſelf once for all of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, ſent him word by Monſieur <hi>Rotelin,</hi> and <hi>Etrangues,</hi> that ſhe had been inform'd by credible perſons, that he was much Indebted, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be high time for her to look about her, before ſhe went on further in the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:65930:179"/>This Anſwer was like a Thunder-Clap to the poor Lover, who after he had recovered himſelf a little, told them, that it was too late now to form ſuch Pretences, and that ſhe ought to have made better enquiry concerning his Condition before things were gone ſo far; that ſhe muſt excuſe him, if he took care of himſelf, ſo as not to be made a Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtock of the Town. That if nothing elſe would do, he muſt have recourſe to Juſtice; but that he being unwilling to expoſe her, he would have her not to let things come to an extremity; that therefore he deſired them to diſcourſe the point ſeriouſly with her, and to perſwade her to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance as they were her Friends; and that if they did not bring him a favourable Anſwer, ſhe muſt expect to be Summoned to anſwer it before a Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>After a few days, they return'd our Country Squire for an Anſwer, that notwithſtanding all their endeavours, there was no hopes left for him, which made him Summon her before the Epiſcopal Court, where ſhe loſt the Cauſe, Judgment being given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, to pay Coſts, Damages and Intereſt. But ſhe entering her Appeal to the Parliament, the Cauſe was again pleaded in full Court, and after a long hearing, Judgment deferr'd till another time, the further Examination of the whole matter being left to a certain Councellor, who within a limitted time was to make his Report to the Court. This Councellor, though none of the youngeſt, yet was ſoon enſnar'd in the ſame Trap in which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Squire had been catch'd before; ſo that when this ſuppoſed Counteſs came to ſollicite her Buſineſs, he told her the very firſt time, that ſhe need not much fear her Cauſe; and after three or four Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits more, began to lay the matter more open to her, and to tell her, that he would engage to carry the Cauſe for her, provided ſhe would make him a ſuitable return. She play'd the Cards ſo dexterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the old Councellor, as cunning as he was,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65930:179"/>
ſerved her for a Paſtime in the ſame manner as the Country Gentleman had done before.</p>
               <p>But after ſhe had thus ſufficiently diverted her ſelf, and her Friends with the Follies of theſe two Sparks, ſhe thought it at laſt high time to lay by the Title and Perſon of a Counteſs, and to quit her Houſe, in order to ſeek for a more convenient Lodging in ſome other part of the Town. <hi>Rote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> and <hi>Etrangues,</hi> were the firſt who brought the Country Squire the News, that his Counteſs was become inviſible, and that they believed that his Proſecution had frightned her to that degree, as to have obliged her to remove from her Houſe. The Country Gentleman uncertain what courſe to take, run ſtraight ways towards the Houſe where ſhe lived, in hopes to hear ſomething or other of her among the Neighbourhood, but all he could learn, was, that this Counteſs <hi>de Meru</hi> had not lived long enough there to be known by them, and that one Monſieur <hi>Chapelier de Villefort</hi> had formerly kept the Houſe, but they did not know that ever he had a Wife. He then enquired whether they could not tell where Monſieur <hi>de Chapelier</hi> lived now, in hopes to hear ſome News of his Miſtriſs by him; but being anſwer'd that Monſieur <hi>Chapelier</hi> was ſuppoſed to be gone into the Country, (as it had been given out on purpoſe) but whither, they could not tell; he began to deſpair of hearing any Tidings from her by this means. But being reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to ſtop here, his next expedient was to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit all the Nunneries of <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſee whether his Miſtreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad not ſheltered herſelf among them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, he happened to come to that of the Abby called <hi>In the Wood, (au Bois)</hi> where having enquired after the Counteſs <hi>de Meru,</hi> they beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch Titles upon him, as did not a little ſurprize him.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, that a certain Lady who had had an Intrigue with this pretended Counteſs of <hi>Meru,</hi> whilſt ſhe yet appeared in the ſhape of a true Man, had been forced to ſhelter herſelf in this
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65930:180"/>
Nunnery, becauſe her Husband, who had got ſome ſcent of it, was become jealous of her; after which it was agreed betwixt her and <hi>Chapelier,</hi> that he ſhould aſſume the Title and Dreſs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>de Meru,</hi> and ſo enter herſelf to Board in the ſame Nunnery where ſhe was.</p>
               <p>The Lady Abbeſs, and the reſt of the Siſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this Nunnery, were a long time before they had the leaſt Suſpicion of any Intrigue, or of his being a Man, and might have continued ſo for a great while after, if the thing had not been unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately diſcovered by a young Girl of eight years old. This Girl was the Daughter of the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who had ſought for Protection in the Nunnery, and as ſhe had formerly often ſeen <hi>Chapelier de Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> with her Mother, knew him, notwithſtanding his Diſguiſe, at firſt ſight, and though her Mother did all what ſhe could to perſwade her to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſometimes would whip her ſeverely, would ſometimes call him by his right Name, which happening one time in the preſence of a Nun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Nunnery, the whole Intrigue was diſcovered.</p>
               <p>All the Nuns being exaſperated at the Perſon who had put ſo groſs a Trick upon them, were reſolved to be revenged upon this pretended Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and ſo to work they went, and after they had ſtript her to the middle, gave her ſuch a flogging Entertainment, that ſhe had reaſon to remember it for a conſiderable time after.</p>
               <p>Our Country Squire asking the Maid that takes care of the turning Box of the Nunnery whether there were not ſuch a one as the Counteſs <hi>de Meru</hi> in the Nunnery, had in lieu of an anſwer, ſuch Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles beſtowed upon him, as raiſed his curioſity to know the reaſon of it. But the Maid, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he play'd upon her, would give him no further Satisfaction, and the more earneſt he was in his enquiring, the more averſe ſhe appear'd to give him an anſwer ſuitable to his Expectation; ſo that he was forced to leave her without receiving any
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65930:180"/>
more Satisfaction, than that the Name of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>de Meru</hi> was well known in that Nunnery. Being under this perplexity, he reſolved to adviſe with his Councellor, unto whom he gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happened to him in that Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery. As good luck would have it, the Councellor's Wife had ſome Acquaintance in this Nunnery, and ſhe promiſed to uſe her utmoſt endeavours to find out this Secret about the Counteſs <hi>de Meru.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accordingly ſhe went the next day to pay a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to ſome of her intimate Acquaintance there, who were ſo kind as to tell her the whole Story a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this pretended Counteſs, and what had been the occaſion the Country Gentleman had met with ſo odd an Entertainment from the Maid. The Councellor gave an Account of it to his Client, who being vexed to the Soul to be thus bubbled of his Money, and to be made a May-game in to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, was reſolved to revenge himſelf upon <hi>Rotelin</hi> and <hi>Etrangues.</hi> But not being able to demand the deſired Satisfaction from the laſt, becauſe he had ſince choſen a Religious Profeſſion, (though formerly he belonged to the Guard of the Grand Musketeers) he reſolved to let <hi>Rotelin</hi> feel the effects of his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, knowing him to be a Perſon who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sword. Accordingly he ſent him a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, but <hi>Rotelin,</hi> who was at that time to be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to a Marſhal of <hi>France</hi>'s Daughter, refuſed not only to give him Satisfaction, but alſo ridicul'd him where-ever he met him, and threatned to provide him his Quarters in the Fort, call'd the <hi>Biſhop's-Fort,</hi> which put the Country Squire into ſuch a fright, that he thought it his beſt way not to meddle any further with him, but to turn all his anger upon <hi>Chapelier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Purſuant to this Intention he went to the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor who had been appointed by the Parliament to make a Report of his Caſe, unto whom he gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in what manner he had been ſerved, deſiring him to procure him a Warrant for the Apprehending of <hi>Chapelier.</hi> This Councellor, who (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know to our Gentleman) was his Brother in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65930:181"/>
and conſequently very glad of this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to revenge himſelf for the Affront put upon him, did not only grant his Requeſt, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the buſineſs in ſo hainous a manner to the Parliament, that they granted their Warrant for the Apprehending of <hi>Chapelier.</hi> But he had got no ſooner ſcent of it, but he retired to a certain Abby belonging to the Chevalier <hi>de Meme,</hi> who was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friend.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Councellor who was to make the Report of this Caſe to the Parliament, was not idle on his ſide, but made all the enquiry he could, concerning his whole Life and Behaviour, which proved to be ſuch, as to render him deſervedly odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God and Men. The Parliament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made their Addreſſes to his Majeſty, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Chapelier</hi>'s obtaining a Pardon by the powerful Interceſſion of Monſieur <hi>de Tellier,</hi> and at the ſame time ſent their Spyes abroad, to find him out where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he might be hid. Monſieur <hi>de Tellier</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that if he ſhould fall into the Hands of the Parliament, he would ſcarce eſcape with Life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeded ſo far with his Majeſty, that in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his near Relation to Monſieur <hi>de Tellier</hi>'s Lady, a Warrant was granted to commit him to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where he might be protected againſt the power of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>la Nove</hi> acted all this while as Deputy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> yet ſo as to depend abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux;</hi> ſo that Monſieur <hi>de Nove</hi> conſidering, that he began to grow very old, and that if another ſhould ſucceed him, he would be ſure to put one of his own Creatures in his Place, he deſired Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> to procure him the King's Commiſſion by his Intereſt at Court. The Governour, who was not willing that he ſhould depend on any body but himſelf, was not very backward in promiſing what he never intended to perform; which made <hi>la Nove,</hi> who was not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Politicks, reſolve not to trouble him any further, but to make uſe of his own Intereſt
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65930:181"/>
at Court. Accordingly he got it repreſented to the King, how that the preſent Governour was grown very old, and conſequently not in a condition to be ſo careful of all the Priſoners as he had been formerly, when he was younger; and that many of the Priſoners had made their eſcapes of late years, becauſe thoſe Officers who acted under him, and had their Dependence upon him, were not in a Capacity to execute their Orders, and to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner, as they would be, if they had their Commiſſions from the King. He further aſſured the Court, that he being by long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acquainted with the whole management of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> he would be obliged to anſwer for the eſcape of any Priſoner from thence, if the King would be pleaſed to grant him his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi> unto whom he had made his Application, liked his Propoſition ſo well, that he ſpoke to the King about it, without mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one word of it to Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> tho' his Son had Married Mrs. <hi>Vitacerf,</hi> a Niece of the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois;</hi> for it is to be obſerved, that the Governour, who was as Politick as any of his Country-men, (who are accounted to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very cunning) made it always his Maxim to Ally himſelf by Marriage to the Miniſters of State, of whoſe Protection, he was ſenſible how much he ſtood often in need, conſidering the frequent abuſes he put upon the Priſoners.</p>
               <p>After the Death of Monſieur <hi>Colbert,</hi> unto whoſe Nephew he had Married one of his Daughters, he inſinuated himſelf into the favour of the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> by a Marriage of his Son with his Niece; and I dare ſay, he is heartily ſorry that he has not another Son or Daughter to diſpoſe of, to engage himſelf by this means into an Alliance with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain,</hi> whom he knows to be a very quick ſighted Miniſter, and conſequently dreads him above all the reſt.</p>
               <p>But the King, though he did not diſapprove Monſieur <hi>de Nove</hi>'s Propoſition, yet conſidering that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65930:182"/>
he had better beſtow a place of ſo much profit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome good Officer who had deſerved it better by his former Services, than upon one who ſcarce ever had look'd further than the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and had offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated more in the Quality of a Keeper or Turn-Key, than in that of a Soldier, pitch'd upon one Monſieur <hi>de Joncas,</hi> Exempt of the Life-Guard, who was put in Monſieur <hi>la Nove</hi>'s place; and becauſe I ſhall have occaſion to mention him hereafter, it may not be amiſs to give you his true Character. He is a very Honeſt and Obliging Perſon, and who having been all his Life-time in the King's Service, has a good ſhare of Experience, and conſequently, is ſenſible of other Mens Misfortunes; for which reaſon, he is always ready to oblige the Priſoners in any thing that is not inconſiſtent with the King's Service.</p>
               <p>He had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of his Place, but he viſited all the Priſoners, unto whom he gave all the imaginable proofs of his Generous and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Behaviour; though at the ſame time, he was very careful in viewing all the Grates and other Places of the Priſon, by which they might make their eſcape.</p>
               <p>It was not long before the Governour and he fell quite to pieces, becauſe he did not think fit to give the leaſt encouragement to his Avarice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſcarriages, which are ſuch, as ſcarce to be comprehended, much leſs to be deſcribed; and of which I have given you ſome general Idea before. Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> was extreamly diſſatisfied at this new Deputy-Governour, becauſe in his Viſits he made to the Priſoners, he would make an enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, upon what account they were put in Priſon, and if he found them to have been ſufficiently Chaſtiz'd by a long Impriſonment, he would intercede for them with the Miniſters at Court. He could alſo not digeſt it very well, that this Deputy-Governor ſhould go into the Kitchin to ſee what Victuals were dreſs'd for the Priſoners, and that he ſhould find fault with them. For it is to be obſerv'd, that
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65930:182"/>
of late we were worſe Treated than if we had Dined at the worſt Six-penny Ordinary in Town; which, whether it proceeded from an Abatement of the King's Allowance ſince the Miniſtry of Monſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain,</hi> or from the Avaritiouſneſs of the Governour, I am not able to determine.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Joncas</hi> did no more in this caſe than what belong'd to his Office, and what was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for the caſe of the Priſoners; yet the Governor's Intereſt ſo far prevail'd with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of State, as to obtain an Order, that <hi>Joncas</hi> ſhould not for the future intermeddle with what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Priſoners; but eſpecially not with their Diet. After this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Joncas</hi> continued his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Civilities, by viſiting the Priſoners, but did not mention one word more of interceeding for them at Court, which made moſt of us imagine, that Monſieur <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> and he underſtood one another very well now, but we were ſoon after undeceived by the Turn key, who told us how matters ſtood betwixt them. For the reſt, he was a Man who acted in his Station with all the Honeſty and Care imaginable, which encouraged <hi>Chapelier</hi> (who always Courted him at a high rate) to tell him one time, that he had ſomething of great moment to impart to him, concerning me, which he had learn'd from my Servant; but that it would be abſolutely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the King's Service, to act with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution imaginable in the matter; and that therefore ſince he had no opportunity to talk with him of it in my preſence, it would be very convenient (if he thought fit) to give me leave to walk upon the Tarraſs the next time my Siſter ſhould come to ſee me, which would furniſh him with an opportunity to give an Account at large of what he knew of me.</p>

               <head>THE MEMOIRS OF JOHN BAPTIST <hi>De La Fontaine,</hi> Kt. LIB. X.</head>
               <p>MOnſieur <hi>de Joncas</hi> had heard ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of my being made a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> on the account of keeping a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Correſpondence with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which made him embrace <hi>Chapelier</hi>'s Offers with a great deal of Satisfaction, not queſtioning but that by this means he ſhould be able to make a full diſcovery of the whole matter. To encourage him in this diſcovery, he told him, that if he could tell him any thing which might conduce to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Service, this would be an infallible means not only to obtain his Liberty after ſo long an Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo to be reconciled to his Relations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom, was the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:65930:183"/>
needed no further Encouragement than this, which made him flatter the Deputy-Governor with what wonders he could tell him, and the next thing he did, was, to bring over <hi>Villeroy</hi> to his ſide, which he found no very hard task to do, by promiſing him Golden Mountains, and that he ſhould be a Sharer in his good Fortune. Thus they took the next Opportunity when my Siſter came to ſee me, and whilſt we were buſie in talking upon the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs, they engaged my <hi>Valet</hi> abſolutely in their Plot againſt me, who indeed was more than half brought over to their ſide before, by <hi>Chapelier.</hi> For this Fellow being quite tired out with the irkſomeneſs of a long Impriſonment, which he thought, would ſcarce end till with my Life, and having been an Eye witneſs of ſome things which paſs'd whilſt I was in <hi>England,</hi> he took a Reſolution to procure his Liberty, though with the loſs of his Maſter, whom he look'd upon as loſt before. The promiſe made him by <hi>Chapelier,</hi> to raiſe his Fortune, had ſuch a powerful Influence upon this Fellow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now reſolved to overcome all that lay in his way, he told them all what he knew, and ſome things he knew not. <hi>Joncas</hi> having by this means underſtood, how I had been admitted to the Pr . . . at <hi>H</hi> . . . . . . . and what particular acceſs I had had to my Lord <hi>S</hi> . . . . . . and my Lord <hi>L</hi> . . . . . . and that I had received ſeveral Letters from them ſince my return into <hi>France;</hi> that I had been in <hi>Poictou,</hi> where I had ſpent ſeveral Months in Converſing with the Proteſtant Gentry; when <hi>Joncas,</hi> I ſay, underſtood all theſe particulars, he did not queſtion, but that by communicating them to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> he ſhould do a piece of Service to the King, which would turn to his great Advantage.</p>
               <p>But as he was a Man of great Prudence, ſo he thought it moſt convenient to ſpeak firſt with my Servant in Perſon, before he communicated the matter to the Marqueſs. For which purpoſe he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to be taken from me, under pretence, that he did not ſerve me as he ought to do; for you
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65930:184"/>
muſt know, that ever ſince he had been engaged in this Intrigue againſt me, he had carried himſelf very ſawcily to me. I am apt to imagine, that <hi>Joncas</hi> did not remove this Servant without the Knowledge and Conſent of the Governour; but this I am ſure of, that he did not impart the leaſt of the ſecret of this diſcovery to him, it being not his Intention that he ſhould ſhare with him the honour and advantage of it. But however it was, my <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> was ſo far from being ſet at Liberty, that on the contrary, he was more cloſely Confined than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for, as they ſuppoſed to have got ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Evidence againſt me, ſo they were very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in preſerving, what they judged of the utmoſt Conſequence to them. Monſieur <hi>Joncas</hi> then came every day to him, and took all his Depoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in writing, which containing four large Pages, he made my Servant ſign with his own Hand.</p>
               <p>The next thing he had to do, was to wait on the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> whom he told, that having a Secret of the greateſt Conſequence to impart to him, he deſired he might talk in private with him. The Miniſter of State having appointed <hi>Joncas</hi> a certain time, when he ſhould be at leiſure to hear him, he did not fail to be there at the prefix'd Hour, when he preſented to the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Memorandum,</hi> of which he received, and peruſed ſome part, but finding that it related only to what he knew better before, he return'd it to him, without taking the pains of reading it quite through. But nothing vexed <hi>Joncas</hi> ſo much, as that the Miniſter ordered him to deliver it to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> the Governour of the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> for as <hi>Joncas</hi> had carried on this Intrigue without the knowledge of the Governor, ſo he was ſenſible that this would ſerve to augment the Miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that was betwixt them before. He ask'd the Miniſter of State before he took his leave of him, what Orders he would be pleaſed to give concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my <hi>Valet,</hi> unto whom he had promiſed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65930:184"/>
Unto which he anſwered, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour might do with him what he pleaſed; ſo that he having no more to ſay, he return'd much diſſatisfied at the Reception he had met with from the Miniſter of State, which was quite different from what he had promiſed to himſelf for the pains he had taken to ſerve the King. That which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his vexation, was, that after his return to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> gave him but a very indifferent Entertainment when he deliver'd to him the <hi>Memorandum,</hi> which had been procured without his knowledge; for he no ſooner had told him what had paſs'd at the Miniſter of State's, and what Orders he had been pleaſed to give, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ask'd him; whether he had been taught thus in the Guards? and whether it were a Cuſtom there for the Subalterns to manage Matters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the knowledge of their Captains? <hi>Joncas</hi> was fain to take this ſmart Reprimand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying one word, being ſenſible that he had not acted as he ought to have done, in a Matter which he ſuppoſed to be of ſo much Conſequence. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> gave my <hi>Valet</hi> his Liberty, and he had a Recompence of thirty Crowns beſides; as the Turn key told me; but whether the Governor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the Deputy-Governor had beſtow'd this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent upon him, I was not able to learn; But thus much I know, that when he came to ſee my Siſter, ſhe did not only give him a very kind Reception, (though I had told her before how he had ſerv'd me) but alſo got him a place in the ſame Nunnery where ſhe Boarded; of which I had a full Account from my Spouſe, who at the ſame time writ me word in what Condition my Domeſtick Affairs were at home, which was ſuch, as proved a new addition to my Affliction; for my Spouſe had all her Lands in her own hands, and for the laſt three years had ſcarce been able to ſell any thing of their Product; ſo that being diſabled to undertake a Journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> I was conſequently bereaved of the aſſiſtance ſhe
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65930:185"/>
might otherwiſe have been able to give me in ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing for my Releaſement at Court.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Marquis <hi>de Louvois</hi> died ſuddenly, which almoſt put me into Deſpair; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I conſidered, that he being the only Perſon, who beſides the King, knew the true ſtate of my Caſe, his Succeſſor might perhaps cauſe me to be proſecuted with the utmoſt rigour of the Law, which at the beſt would have amounted to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Impriſonment. Thus, not knowing what courſe beſt to take, I ſent to my Spouſe to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> which ſhe would willingly have comply'd with, but that for want of Money ſhe could not undertake ſuch a Journey; ſo that I had no other remedy left me but Patience. The next following Year hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to prove very bad for the Fruits of the Earth, occaſioned ſuch an exceſſive Dearth, that every thing was raiſed to four times the Price it bore before that time: This was however a good hit for me, for my Spouſe had good ſtore of Wheat and Wines, which ſhe Sold at ſo high a Rate, that ſhe ſaved a good Portion out of it for our Eldeſt Daughter.</p>
               <p>A certain Gentleman living near <hi>Tours,</hi> (whoſe Name was <hi>Leugny</hi>) was faln in Love with this Daughter of mine, and as he was a Man of a very good Eſtate, my Spouſe thought ſhe could do no better than to forward the Match, tho' ſhe was ſenſible that the Gentleman's Mother did not approve of it; as believing, that when it was paſt Remedy, ſhe would be prevail'd upon to be reconciled to her Son, which indeed was alſo my Opinion; in which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, both my Spouſe and my ſelf have found our ſelves miſtaken hitherto; for notwithſtanding that my Son-in-Law's Uncle, who is Dean of our Lady's Church, and who likewiſe oppoſed this Match at firſt, has ſince given his Conſent, ſhe perſiſts in her former Reſolution.</p>
               <p>Some time after the Nuptials, my new Son-in-Law having ſome Buſineſs of Conſequence to tranſact at <hi>Paris,</hi> took his Wife along with him; and knowing
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65930:185"/>
that I had leave to be viſited by my Family, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd themſelves to Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be admitted to ſee me: But the Governour, who knew that my Son-in-Law's Uncle had a great many Friends at Court, and feared not without reaſon, that he might make uſe of his Intereſt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my Liberty, took my Daughter aſide, and told her in private, that he was ſorry to tell her that I was grown Diſtracted, a thing which frequently happened to thoſe unfortunate Perſons, who are forced to ſpend their days in the <hi>Bastile;</hi> that he had taken care to put me into the Hands of an able Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, a Man of approved Experience in ſuch Caſes as this, by whoſe aſſiſtance he hoped, I might be reſtored to my Senſes in time; but that as the caſe now ſtood, he would not Adviſe her to ſee me; partly becauſe my ill Behaviour might make ſome ſtrange impreſſion or other upon her Husband, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it might prove prejudicial to my Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; there being no queſtion, but that the ſight of her would recall to my Memory all the unfortunate Circumſtances that attend ſo long an Impriſonment, and conſequently would occaſion ſuch a violent agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in my Blood and Spirits, as would not be eaſie to be appeaſed by the Art of Men.</p>
               <p>Theſe Perſuaſions of Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> had ſuch an influence upon my Daughter and Son-in-Law, that they thought it beſt not to ſee me. On the other hand, my own Siſter, (who, as I believe had been ſet on by the Governour) did publiſh the ſame all over the Country where I lived; nay, ſhe had one day the impudence to tell it to my Spouſe her ſelf; and to increaſe her Affliction, to aſſure her, that I had been carried from the <hi>Baſtile</hi> to the Mad-Houſe: Her Impudence did not ſtop here, for being ſome time after come with my Spouſe to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe went with her to the publick Mad-Houſe, and in her hearing, ask'd the Porter, Whether about ſuch and ſuch a time there had not been brought a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thither, whoſe Name was <hi>Fontenay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:65930:186"/>My Daughter returning thus without ſeeing me into the Country, my Spouſe beſtowed all her time in managing our Houſe-Affairs to the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: I had left her a Coach with ſix Horſes, and a ſuitable Equipage, which in that Country, where every thing is very cheap, does not put one to any great Expences; however, as ſoon as ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of my Impriſonment, ſhe diſpoſed of the Coach and Horſes, and put off all her Servants, except a ſmall Chariot, and one Chamber-Maid; ſo that, what with her good Management, and what with the Advantage of the Products of our Grounds, which continued to Sell at a very dear Rate, ſhe laid up a good Sum of Money. The firſt thing ſhe did was to pay off a Debt of Four thouſand Livres, which I had borrow'd of the Count <hi>de Serrant</hi> juſt before I left <hi>France</hi> in order to my being tranſported into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The reſt ſhe laid aſide for the uſe of two other Daughters, the eldeſt of which was but two years younger than ſhe that was Married lately, and the other was alſo near 17 years of Age. Thus God Almighty was pleaſed to diſpoſe. Matters for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our Family, it being unqueſtionable, that if I had been at liberty, I ſhould ſcarce have Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded matters ſo well.</p>
               <p>Tho' <hi>Chapelier</hi> and <hi>Villeroy,</hi> my two Chamber-Fellows, had found themſelves miſtaken in their hopes, of obtaining their Liberty by the Treachery of my Servant; nevertheleſs, the firſt of theſe two, had the good fortune to be delivered not long after from his long Impriſonment; for one day, as we were talking together, and when he leaſt expected it, the Turn-Key came in, and told him, that he ſhould dreſs himſelf, and take all that he had along with him; which he did accordingly, and was transferr'd from the <hi>Baſtile</hi> to another Priſon, in order to his Diſcharge, which he obtain'd in a little while after. Thus <hi>Villeroy</hi> and I remain'd only in the Room, and I had this for an additional Affliction, that in two whole years I heard not the leaſt News from my Family, notwithſtanding I ſent ſeveral Letters to my
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65930:186"/>
Spouſe, and (as I was ſufficiently convinced ſince) ſhe was very careful never to miſs anſwering them But the Governour, through whoſe Hands all our Letters muſt of neceſſity paſs, underſtanding that I deſired my Spouſe to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections I gave her, to ſollicite my Releaſement, was reſolved to prevent it, by keeping both her and my Letters in his Hands. I could not for my life gueſs at the meaning of it, ſometimes I fanſied ſhe might be Dead, ſometimes that it might be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors Fault, as indeed it was; and yet, I could not but imagine, that if it were ſo, my Spouſe might for all this come to <hi>Paris,</hi> and be ſatisfied in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her ſelf; and when I ruminated upon this point, I thought I could ſcarce forgive her for ſuch a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Sometimes I would be contriving how to find out a way to diſcover the Truth, but all in vain, the Governour having taken effectual care to prevent it; But as neceſſity is the Mother of Invention, and that nothing ſharpens a Man's Wits more than the hopes of putting an end to ones Miſery, ſo at laſt I pitch'd upon a way which ſucceeded according to my Expectation. I threw out through the Grates, a Letter wrapt up in a Paper, in which I begg'd of ſuch as ſhould happen to take it up, to deliver the Letter according to Direction, for which they ſhould receive a reward of a Crown-piece, if they would accept of it; but if the Perſon ſhould be above the receiving ſuch a Reward, that God would infallibly recompence the care they took for an unfortunate Priſoner. In the Letter (directed to a particular Friend of mine) I had deſired them to write to my Spouſe, if ſhe were ſtill alive, and if not, to my Children, to give them to underſtand, that I had heard nothing of them theſe two years, at which I was moſt extreamly ſurprized, as not knowing what could be the reaſon of it, ſince they had leave from Court to write to me, and to receive Letters from me; That for my part, I had ſent ſo many to them, that it was the greateſt wonder to me in the World that I had received no Anſwer upon any of them;
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65930:187"/>
That they might eaſily imagine, that this neglect of theirs could not but be a ſignal addition to my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; but that however I did flatter my ſelf, that there was ſomething more than ordinary in it, and therefore I deſired ſome of them to come forthwith to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to endeavour to ſee me.</p>
               <p>I took the opportunity of the Evening, when it was juſt dusky, and ſo threw this Letter into the Road which leads to St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Gate, and it was taken up, as I ſuppoſe, the next morning early, and carried ſafely to the place whither it was directed. By this means my Spouſe was informed how matters ſtood, and ſoon after I had the good fortune to ſend to her ſeveral other Letters, by the aſſiſtance of one of my Fellow-Priſoners in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> who having obtained leave to ſee his Family. I conveyed my Letters to him through a hole I had made for that purpoſe. My Wife happening at that time to be very ill, and conſequently being not in a condition to undertake the Journey, ſhe prevailed upon my eldeſt Daughter and her Husband to come to <hi>Paris.</hi> Accordingly ſhe addreſs'd her ſelf to the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> who began to rehearſe the old Story to her, and to tell her, that ſhe would act a very imprudent part to ſee me in that Condition I was in then, and that tho' her Husband were never ſo fond of her, it could not but be a great diſſatisfaction to him to ſee his Father-in-Law act the mad-Man, which in proceſs of time might turn to her Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>My Daughter anſwered the Governor, That ſhe had all the reaſon in the World to be ſurprized at what he told her, becauſe ſhe had ſeen lately ſeveral of my Letters written to her Mother, which did not contain the leaſt thing that had any reſemblance to what: might be ſuppoſed to come from a mad-Man's hands. The Governor ſtood amazed when he heard her ſay, that they had received Letters from me, which made him ask her ſeveral times, whether ſhe was certain that theſe Letters had been of my own hand Writing; for as he kept me under Lock and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65930:187"/>
Key, and did not believe that I could have any Pen, Ink, or Paper without his permiſſion, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly puzzled to find out how this came to paſs. But finding my Daughter very poſitive in what ſhe had told him before, and being a Man of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preſence of Mind, and who knows how to diſentangle himſelf upon any Emergency, (of which I ſhall give you ſeveral inſtances, in a peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I intend, if God be pleaſed to ſpare my Life, of the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>) He being, as I told you before, a Man of a great Preſence of Mind upon any Emergency; he anſwered my Daughter, That he had indeed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me to have certain lucid Intervals, and that poſſibly it might be, that I had written thoſe Letters when my Frenzy had left me. To be ſhort, Theſe and ſuch like Perſuaſions had ſo ſtrong an influence upon my Daughter, that ſhe thought it beſt not to ſee me; and ſo both her Husband and ſhe returned into the Country, with a full Confirmation of the diſmal News my Spouſe had received before of my pretended Madneſs.</p>
               <p>My Servant, who at that time lived in the ſame Monaſtery where my Siſter was, was the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World who could have convinced them of the untruth of the matter; but, beſides that he had not parted very fairly from me, my Siſter took care to ſet him more and more againſt me; ſo that in lieu of undeceiving my Family, he did what he could to ſpread it about the Country, that the thing was really ſo, as the Governour had told my Daughter. Thus having for a conſiderable time lived in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an Anſwer to my ſeveral Letters, (but in vain) I ſtudied ſeveral ways to write to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and to give them to underſtand how much ſurprized I was at their ſilence, and to ſee me thus neglected by my neareſt Friends. My Spouſe, who has a good Natural Underſtanding, finding that there was not the leaſt tincture of Extravagancy in all theſe Letters, could not forbear to take our Eldeſt Daughter to Task, and to ask her, What could be the meaning of it? My Daughter being prepoſſeſs'd
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65930:188"/>
with what ſhe had heard the Governour of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> ſay, concerning my Diſtemper, anſwer'd her, That it muſt be, that I had writ theſe Letters in my lucid Intervals, which indeed did give the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans no ſmall hopes of my Recovery, provided I were not diſturbed by the ſight of any of my Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. My Spouſe being thus again overcome by theſe apparent Reaſons, I found my ſelf deſtitute of all human Aid, which put me upon a deſperate Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to take the next opportunity, when our Turn-Key ſhould come to bring us our Supper, to Lock him up in the Chamber with <hi>Villeroy,</hi> (who had given his Conſent) in the mean while to try my fortune, whether I could not find out a conveniency of conveying another Letter to my Spouſe.</p>
               <p>You muſt know, that among others, the Marquis <hi>de Cruſſol,</hi> was at that time Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> but knowing him to have the liberty of the Court, I flattered my ſelf that by his aſſiſtance I might have a Letter ſent to my Spouſe; for not having received the leaſt Anſwer upon all thoſe I had writ before, I could not but imagine, that they had miſcarried. I did, I ſay, flatter my ſelf, that the Marqueſs <hi>de Cruſſol,</hi> being a Perſon of Quality, his Inclinations would be anſwerable to his Extraction, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he would be glad to put an Obligation upon another Gentleman his Fellow-Priſoner, in a caſe which might be done without the leaſt trouble on his ſide, becauſe all thoſe who are Priſoners at large in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> have the liberty of ſending their Servants abroad, when and where they pleaſe, and of ſeeing their Friends without Controul.</p>
               <p>I did put my deſign in Execution without much difficulty, and ſo ſtreight I went to the Marquis <hi>de Cruſſol</hi> his Chamber, which I was not unacquainted with, becauſe I could look to it by the means of a hole I had made on one ſide of mine, from whence I uſed to ſee him look frequently out of his Window. After I had pay'd him the uſual reſpect, I told him what my Requeſt was, which he promiſed me gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to do; but I ſoon found to my Coſt, that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65930:188"/>
there is a vaſt difference betwixt promiſing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming; for inſtead of keeping his Word with me, he gave both my Letter, and another of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Fellows, <hi>Villeroy,</hi> (which he had deſired me to deliver to him at the ſame time) to the Governour Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux.</hi> I did not think it my beſt way to tarry long with the Marqueſs <hi>de Cruſſol,</hi> for fear the Turn-Key ſhould make a noiſe at our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Door, for, I had taken care to nail a Board on the inſide of our Window, to prevent his calling for help from thence. But, as I was returning to our Chamber, I met with Monſieur <hi>Joncas,</hi> ſo that looking upon this as the moſt ſeaſonable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that could happen, to make an excuſe for what I had done to the Turn-Key, (which is look'd upon as a conſiderable Crime there) I began to make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Complaints againſt him; but all what I could ſay upon this point ſtood me but in little ſtead; for the Governour Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> who ſoon gueſs'd at the true meaning of it, would not let me come off unpuniſh'd, and therefore removed me out of my Chamber, which was a pretty good one, to a much worſe Lodging, which by reaſon of its Dampneſs, occaſioned a Rheumatiſm, which took away the uſe of my Limbs all over one ſide of my Body. Notwithſtanding which, the Governour did not take the leaſt care to appoint me a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Lodging, till the Phyſician of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> put him into a fright, that in all likelihood I had not long to live. This was the ſame Phyſician I had occaſion to ſpeak of before, and I muſt confeſs, that if my preſent Circumſtances had not been ſuch, as to leave me not the leaſt room for Mirth, I could have laugh'd heartily at his Ignorance. For you muſt know, that being almoſt Blind, he laid hold of my Arm above the Elbow in order to feel my Pulſe, inſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of my Hand, and very ſeriouſly told Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Joncas,</hi> who was come along with him, that my Pulſe was very weak, but he perceived no ſigns of a Fever; which made <hi>Joncas</hi> Smile, and I could not forbear telling him, that I thought the King might
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65930:189"/>
very well ſave the Money he gave him; for beſides that I knew him by Experience to be no great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer in his Profeſſion, and conſequently expected no great matter from him, he had made me a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment when he viſited me firſt of all, which was not at all pleaſing to me. For being a Creature of the Governour's, he very gravely told me, that the Chamber I was in now, was a very handſome Lodging, and that Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> could not have pitch'd upon a more convenient one for me in the whole <hi>Baſtile;</hi> though at the ſame time he knew that the Chamber he had ſeen me in before, was much more handſome and healthful. Thus, though I made preſſing inſtances to be removed from thence, I could not obtain that Favour, and ſaw my ſelf under a neceſſity to continue there du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time my Diſtemper laſted, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix weeks; and to mend the matter, I had no body allott'd me to attend me in lieu of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who had left me ſome time before, and I have all the reaſon in the World to believe, that for theſe four Years laſt paſt, the Governor has received an Allowance for him from the King, though I have not been in the leaſt the better for it. After ſix Weeks were expired, I began to be able to ſtir my ſelf a little again, but in ſo weak a condition, that the Turn-key was forced to Dreſs and Undreſs me every day, the uſe of all my Limbs having been taken away from me. My Food was ſuitable to my Attendance, for I had nothing more but my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Allowance, and it happening juſt in Lent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, my chief Nouriſhment was Peaſe, and now and then a ſmall piece of a Carp.</p>
               <p>Thus I continued for two Months longer in a ſtate of reconvaleſcency, and was ſcarce well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, when two days before the Feaſt of St. <hi>John,</hi> I was ſuddenly, as I was ſitting at Table, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an Apoplexy. I had forgot to tell you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ever ſince I had been removed out of my firſt Chamber, <hi>Villeroy</hi> had been ſeparated from me; ſo that during the whole time of my laſt Sickneſs, I
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:65930:189"/>
was left deſtitute of all Company, unleſs when I ſaw the Turn-key. This proved the more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to me, for I happened to be quite alone when I was ſeized with this Apoplexy, and as I fell from my Chair with the Head upon the Ground, a dangerous Contuſion enſued, which I was not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of at firſt, but proved very troubleſome in its conſequence. It was not long before the Turn-key coming up in order to take away the Table-Cloath, he found me lying upon the Floor without ſenſe or motion. But this worthy Pillar of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> was ſo little moved at the ſight of it, that without giving himſelf any further trouble he left me as I was, and went about his buſineſs, as if it had not been worth his while to trouble himſelf about a matter of ſo little moment; and all the excuſe he made, when he was called in queſtion about it afterwards, was, that he thought I had been troubled with the Falling-Sickneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who had his Lodgings in a Chamber juſt under mine, and who uſed to talk with me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through a hole which he had made in the Ciel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did call to me aloud, but finding me to give him no anſwer, began to ſuſpect ſome ſiniſter Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident had befallen me. This made him call to one of the Soldiers, who ſtand Sentinels all about the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> to prevent the Eſcape of any Priſoners, or their having any Correſpondence together through the Windows, <hi>Villeroy,</hi> I ſay, deſired one of theſe Sentinels to give notice to ſome of the Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> that they muſt with all ſpeed come to my Chamber.</p>
               <p>They came accordingly, and ſeeing me in the ſame Condition, as I told you before, ſent forthwith a Meſſenger to fetch the Apothecary belonging to the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> but as he dwelt above half a Leagre from thence, ſo it was a whole Hour before he came to adminiſter his Remedies, ſuch as they were; for I believe moſt People will eaſily grant me, that the Advice of an Apothecary in ſo nice a caſe as this, is not much to be rely'd on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:65930:190"/>I will however give him thus far his due, that he was a tolerable good Maſter of his Art, and in this reſpect I was more obliged to them than if they had ſent for the Chirurgeon of the Priſon, who had learn'd his Trade and ſerv'd his Apprenticeſhip no where but in the Governor's Houſe, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Servant he actually is to this Day, and has obtained this Employment (for which he has an Annual Sallery of four hundred Livres Yearly) by his Maſter's Intereſt, who thus pays him his Wages out of the King's Purſe.</p>
               <p>But to return to our purpoſe; the Apothecary being come, apply'd all the Remedies he could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diviſe, and did torment me for ſeveral Hours before there appear'd the leaſt ſign of Life in me. In the mean while Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> was alſo come into the Room, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> hearing his Tongue among the reſt that ſtood about me, cry'd out aloud to me, that I ſhould Cite him before the Tribunal of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the Perſon who made it his buſineſs to continue all the Priſoners in the miſerable State they were in, for his filthy Lucre ſake. It is to be obſerved, That the Governor had been very Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in preventing the Releaſement of <hi>Villeroy;</hi> which had been promiſed him by the Miniſter of State, at the Interceſſion of the Marqueſs <hi>de Lavar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> who having ſent notice of it to the Priſoner, by Monſieur <hi>Joncas,</hi> the Deputy-Governor, he was ſo imprudent, as to diſcover it to the Turn-key who attended him in his Chamber, and the Turn-key having ſoon given notice of it to the Governor, he waited on the Miniſter of State immediately, and by his Intrigues overturned all that had been done by the Marqueſs <hi>de Lavardin</hi> in the Priſoner's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. <hi>Villeroy</hi> would frequently ask Monſieur <hi>Jon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> when he ſhould be ſo fortunate as to be made ſenſible of the effects of thoſe Promiſes made to him? Who at laſt gave him for an Anſwer, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Marqueſs <hi>de Lavardin;</hi> that if he had had a mind to get out of Priſon, he ought to have
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65930:190"/>
been more careful of his Tongue; and that if he continued there longer than he expected, he muſt impute it to his own Miſmanagement.</p>
               <p>But the Governor hearing him to talk at ſuch an extravagant rate, ſent word to him inſtantly by one of his Turn-keys, that if he ſaid one word more, he would provide him his Quarters in the Dungeon. <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who but lately had been an Eye witneſs of what had happened of this kind upon much leſs occaſions than this, had ſo much wit for this time, as to hold his Tongue. And to confeſs the truth, it was high time for him to chooſe the ſafeſt way; for it was not long before, that a Nephew of the Marqueſs <hi>de Caſtanaga,</hi> Governor of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> had been ſerved ſuch a Trick by the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> of which I would have given you a more ample Account in this Treatiſe, if I did not intend to reſerve it for the Treatiſe of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> which I hope to publiſh before long.</p>
               <p>Being at laſt returned a little to my ſenſes by the help of Bleeding, and ſome other proper Remedies, Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> who deſpaired of my Life, ſent for the Almoner belonging to the Priſon, unto whom I made my Confeſſion as well as I was able to do, I having not then recovered the uſe of my Tongue; and for four Hours after, whilſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner ſtaid with me, I continued ſo ill, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no leſs than my Death every moment. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, I began to recover all my Senſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to be ſenſible of what I had not felt before; but eſpecially the Contuſion occaſion'd by my fall, began to be very painfull, and at laſt came to a Suppuration, which iſſued through the Ears. The Apothecary, who continued his Viſits, look'd upon it as a good ſign, and aſſured me, that he was certain, this would not a little contribute to the recovery of my Health; and the Succeſs was in ſome meaſure anſwerable to his Prognoſtication, if that may be term'd a ſtate of Health, when a Diſtemper appears under a different ſhape; for I
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65930:191"/>
was ſeized with a Palſie all over the right ſide of my Body. Being adviſed to the uſe of the Baths, I deſired the Governour of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> to intercede in my behalf with the Marqueſs <hi>de Barbeſieux</hi> to grant me leave to go to the Bath, and I offered ſufficient Bail for my return at an appointed time; nay, there was one of my Kinſmen who offered to be bound for me, Body for Body, till my return from the Bath. But whether the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> did not think fit to propoſe it to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, or whether the Court would not hearken to his Interceſſion, I am not able to judge; becauſe I never received the leaſt anſwer. I had then nothing left me but patience to arm my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tediouſneſs of ſo long an Impriſonment, in which I am afraid, I am likely to finiſh my days. A very odd Recompence for the many faithful Services I have partly done, and partly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do to the State. The conſideration of ſuch a Fatality would be ſufficient to put me quite into Deſpair, if God Almighty had not been ſo Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me as to comfort me without intermiſſion, by the Reflections I make upon what our Saviour, who was without all blemiſh, beyond what can be conceived by us Mortals, has ſuffered for me; and that conſequently, I who have committed ſo many Sins, ought patiently to ſubmit to thoſe Chaſtize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God has been pleaſed to lay upon me.</p>
               <p>Not long before I found my ſelf ſtrong enough to get out of Bed, the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> had ſo much Humanity left, as to ſend me a Letter which my Spouſe had writ to me, in which ſhe deſired my Conſent to a Marriage betwixt my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Daughter and a certain Gentleman whoſe Name was <hi>la Broſſe.</hi> I am apt to believe this Complaiſance proceeded not ſo much from any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Inclination towards me, or from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my preſent Condition, as from the fear he had of diſobliging the Duke <hi>de Mazarin,</hi> who not only encouraged this Match, but alſo offered to give her an additional Portion of ſix Thouſand
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65930:191"/>
Livres; there wanted nothing towards bringing this Match to a concluſion, but my Approbation in Writing, which they deſired me to ſend with all poſſible ſpeed, and at the ſame time to inform them concerning the preſent ſtate of my Health, and whether I was deſirous that my Spouſe ſhould come to <hi>Paris</hi> after the Conſummation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman who delivered this Letter to me, brought a Publick Notary along with him to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my Hand-writing, and he told me at the ſame time, that Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux</hi> had given leave that I might write to my Spouſe, under Condition that I ſhould not mention any thing to her but what related to the propoſed Marriage; and that, if I inſerted any thing elſe, he would neither ſend my Letter, nor my Approbation. I leave it to any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Jugdment, how welcome a Complement this muſt needs be to one in that Condition I was then; but knowing my ſelf at the diſpoſal of a barbarous Wretch, neceſſity did oblige me to obſerve his Orders with the greateſt exactneſs that could be, I took however this Opportunity to write her a long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which I enlarged my ſelf upon the many Inconveniencies which attend a Match, if every thing be not pondred in all its Circumſtances before its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; admoniſhing them to be careful to act with all imaginable Circumſpection in a thing of ſo nice a nature. My Spouſe having received this Letter, read it over ſeveral times, and the oftener ſhe peruſed it, the more ſhe was convinced that this did not in the leaſt ſavour of any Indiſpoſition of my Brains. She was indeed much ſurpriz'd I ſhould not make the leaſt mention of the preſent ſtate of my Health, neither of her coming to <hi>Paris;</hi> but by making ſerious Reflections upon the whole, ſhe at laſt hit upon the truth of the matter, and if ſhe was not fully convinced of it, ſhe at leaſt ſhrewdly Conjectured, that there muſt be ſome Myſtery in the bottom, which ſhe would endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:65930:192"/>
by her coming to <hi>Paris,</hi> immediately after the Conſummation of her Daughters Marriage.</p>
               <p>There happened alſo another thing, which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her departure. For the Intendant of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Poictou,</hi> had, according to Orders received from Court, ſent ſome Officers to take poſſeſſion of my Houſe in the Country, for the payment of a Debt, which, as it was pretended, was owing from me to the King. But my Spouſe went to wait on him, and having given him to underſtand, that I was a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, (which was confirm'd by the principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Loudun</hi>) he withdrew his Myrmidons. My Spouſe much ſurprized at this Accident, of which the Intendant could not give her a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Account, made all the haſte ſhe could to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> with an intention to ſpeak with me before ſhe went to preſent herſelf before Monſieur <hi>de Pont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatrain.</hi> The Governor of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> was amazed to ſee her there, after all the Pains he had taken to prevent her coming to <hi>Paris;</hi> ſhe told him the reaſon which had obliged her to come to Town, which he knew to be no more than what was really true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Monſieur <hi>Pontchartrain</hi> had told him, that he had been theſe twelve Months looking for me, and that if he had known I was in the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> he might have ſaved himſelf that trouble.</p>
               <p>He then told my Spouſe, that he would adviſe her to act with a great deal of Precaution in this Point; that I had been very ill of late, and being juſt now upon my recovery, the ſight of her might prove very prejudicial to my Health. He had not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence enough to tell her in plain terms, that I was out of my Senſes, but being ſenſible that ſhe had heard of it before; nay, that my Siſter had carried her the laſt time ſhe was in <hi>Paris,</hi> to the Mad-Houſe, to enquire after me; he only gave her ſome hints of what he would have her take for Truth. But my Spouſe being reſolved not to be kept any further in ſuſpenſe by theſe, and many other ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Reaſons, he pretended to alledge to her, told
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65930:192"/>
him poſitively, that ſhe would and muſt ſee me, as long as ſhe had got leave from Court; and that if he refuſed her admittance, ſhe knew where to apply herſelf for Redreſs.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>Baiſenaux</hi> finding her ſo reſolute, did not think it his beſt way to give her a flat denial; but told her, that the Warrant ſhe had obtained from the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> was of no force ſince his Death, and that therefore ſhe muſt now apply herſelf to Monſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was now to take Cogniſance of me, as ſhe might eaſily gueſs by what had lately happened at her Houſe. He offered at the ſame time to make uſe of all his Intereſt with the ſaid Miniſter, and to ſpeak to him the very next opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Warrant for her.</p>
               <p>But my Spouſe being reſolved not to rely upon his promiſe, went the next day to wait on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain,</hi> who was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> deſiring his Protection; he gave her for anſwer, that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to get me releaſed out of Priſon, would be to engage me to give ſatisfaction to the King, for ſome words I was accountable for to the Court. That in the mean while ſhe ſhould have leave to ſee me, and that he would diſpatch his Warrant for that purpoſe immediately; Monſieur <hi>de Baiſenaux,</hi> Governor of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> happened to be in the Room at the ſame time, though at ſome diſtance from the Miniſter, who having got ſight of him, ſent one of his Servants to let him know that he wanted to ſpeak with him. He ask'd him in my Spouſe's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whether ſhe might ſee her Husband without any Hazard or Inconveniency; Monſieur <hi>de Baiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naux</hi> not thinking it for his purpoſe to contradict the Miniſter of State, for fear of Exaſperating my Spouſe, anſwered, That he knew of no Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and ſo having received Orders from his own Mouth to let her ſee and ſpeak with me. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her in Perſon up to my Chamber, in hopes that his preſence might at leaſt retard a diſcovery, which he knew muſt needstend to his Confuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:65930:193"/>I had been ſome time before removed out of that Chamber where I had lain ill ſo long, and was ſince lodged in another in the Tower of the Treaſury, which was much more wholeſome for its Situation than the former. I had a Chamber-Fellow there, who was an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> and had ſerved in the Quality of a Captain of Foot under King <hi>James,</hi> but being fallen under Suſpicion of keeping Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Enemy, was Committed to the <hi>Baſtile;</hi> this being the ſecond time, for he had been there once before upon the ſame account. Here it was my Spouſe came to ſee me, and the ſight of her did ſo much amaze me, that what with the ſurprize, and the conſideration of finding my ſelf thus neglected by her, I gave her but a cold Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſo ſtartled the poor Creature, that ſhe was ready to Swoun away.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt ſtep toward the diſcovery ſo much fear'd by the Governor, who did all what in him lay to prevent it, by interrupting us in our Diſcourſe; but no ſooner did my Spouſe hear me reproach her with want of Duty and Care, but ſhe diſcloſed the whole Myſtery in the Governor's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. If I was ſurpriz'd at the ſight of her, I ſtood quite amaz'd at the recital ſhe made me of his Treachery, which was of ſo hainous a nature, that nothing could be beyond it; and I am almoſt convinced, that if his Majeſty were rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of it, he would according to his Juſtice, make the Governour pay for it with no leſs than the loſs of his Place.</p>
               <p>My Spouſe, who could not forbear crying when I reproach'd her with her want of Love, was all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Grief, when ſhe ſaw me in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I was in, Lame and Helpleſs, not being able to ſtir one of my Hands and Legs. After many Tears, Sighs and Sobbs, ſhe at laſt told me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Seiſure of the Intendant of <hi>Poictou,</hi> and what Monſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain</hi> had told her about my being accountable for Words to the King;
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65930:193"/>
proteſting, That if nothing elſe was in the way to obtain my Liberty, ſhe would ſet all at ſtake, to deliver me out of Priſon. She deſired me, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her thus far, as to let her know, what account it was I had with the Court about words againſt the King that ſhe might be able to give a ſatisfactory Anſwer to Monſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain,</hi> at her next Audience. I told her that this Diſcourſe was a Riddle to me, which I did not know how to unfold; being ſure that I had not the leaſt Concerns with the Court upon account of words, or any thing like it. That ſhe was ſenſible herſelf, that my Buſineſs had always been Soldiery, that I had left <hi>France</hi> very young, and had liv'd Abroad twenty Years, that ſhe was an Eye witneſs of what I had done ever ſince; and that therefore, ſhe needed but to conſult her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to tell the Miniſter of State what ſhe was ſure of by her own knowledge, as well as my ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Governor of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> who is obliged to give frequent Attendance to this Miniſter, by reaſon of his Employment, took once the opportunity to give him to underſtand, what I had declared upon that Head, which having induced Monſieur <hi>de Pontchartrain</hi> to make a more narrow enquiry into the matter, he found that it was not I, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the King, but one <hi>Fontenai,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a Commiſſioner of the Navy, was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Malverſation in his Office, he having been employed to buy a conſiderable quantity of Wood for the King's uſe, to be employed in the building of ſome Men of War.</p>
               <p>My Spouſe coming ſometime after to wait on the Miniſter of State, he told her that the Intendant had been miſtaken in Seizing upon my Eſtate; and ſhe intreating him to order my Releaſement, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That it did not belong to him, but that ſhe muſt make her Application to the Marqueſs <hi>de Barbeſieux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:65930:194"/>Accordingly ſhe deſired Audience of the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, and repreſented to him (in hopes to move him to Compaſſion) that one half of my Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeized with a Palſie, ſhe begg'd of him to take pity upon her and me, and to grant me my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But whether the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> had by his malicious Inſinuations gain'd his point againſt me, as well with the Son, as with the Father, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> or whether it was that the miſery of others made not any conſiderable impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this young Miniſter of State, he gave her this unexpected anſwer; That it was his Opinion, ſhe needed not be ſo much concerned at my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in lieu of looking upon it as a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune on her ſide, ſhe might rather wiſh that in lieu of one ſide of my Body, both were ſeized with the Palſie.</p>
               <p>I will give every body leave to judge, what were my Thoughts when my Spouſe gave me an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Entertainment; and I muſt freely confeſs, that being ſatisfied in my own Conſcience of my Innocence, and how little I had deſerved ſuch a harſh Treatment, I was upon the point of laying Violent Hands upon my ſelf (as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have done in this unfortunate Priſon, of which, more in my Treatiſe of the <hi>Baſtile</hi>) but that God Almighty was pleaſed to aſſiſt me with his Mercy in a moſt peculiar manner againſt theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. My Spouſe, who as you may imagine, was not able to hear ſuch an anſwer without ſhedding a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Tears, could not contain herſelf from burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into Tears afreſh, when ſhe gave me an Account of it: ſo that though I was the Perſon that ſtood moſt of all in need of Comfort, I was forced to be her Comforter.</p>
               <p>I have been credibly inform'd ſince by one of the Officers belonging to the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> that this harſh Treatment (was not owing ſo much to the Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the Governor of the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> or to the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs of this young Miniſter of State, as to the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65930:194"/>
maliciouſneſs of <hi>Chapelier,</hi> (whom I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) who after his Releaſement out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had, as it ſeems, told his Kinſman, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Barbeſieux,</hi> that I had ſpoken ſlightingly of his Family, a thing which never in the leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my Thoughts.</p>
               <p>Finding my ſelf thus bereaved of all Humane Aſſiſtance, I turn'd all my Thoughts to God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe entire diſpoſal I ſubmitted both my ſelf and Family; I ſpent much of my time in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to bring over my Spouſe to the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, in repreſenting to her, that conſidering every thing God had been pleaſed: thro' his Mercy to order every thing for the beſt, in order to draw me from the love of the World, unto which I had formerly reſigned moſt of my affections; nay, that he had been pleaſed to order matters for the beſt, in reſpect of our Family, which in all likelihood, would ſcarce have been in ſo good a Condition, if he had not laid this Affliction upon me; that two of our Daughters were Married al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that I did not doubt, God would find means for her to diſpoſe of the reſt of her Children without my Aſſiſtance. She earneſtly deſired me to give her leave to throw herſelf at His Majeſty's Feet, to implore His Mercy in my behalf, which I did conſent to, merely not to diſoblige her, and to give ſome ſatisfaction to the reſt of my Family, though at the ſame time, I was of Opinion, that this would rather do me harm than good, being ſenſible that the King always gives ſuch Petitions as are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to his Miniſters of State; and theſe Miniſters, who look upon it as a Diminution of their Authority, if Buſineſſes do not paſs through their Hands, do commonly oppoſe themſelves to thoſe Petitions. This is ſo general a Maxim at the <hi>French</hi> Court, that you ſhall ſcarce ever ſee a true bred Courtier ſpeak to the King in private, unleſs they firſt have Communicated their Buſineſs to the Miniſters of State.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:65930:195"/>I remember very well, that the Cardinal of <hi>Fuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> himſelf, ſome years ago, when the King had moſt occaſion of his Intereſt, durſt never attempt to ſpeak to his Majeſty of any Buſineſs of Moment, before he had conſulted about it with the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois,</hi> of whom he was, as it may be ſaid, to ask permiſſion before-hand.</p>
               <p>The Sequel of the Buſineſs was a convincing Argument that I had not been miſtaken in my gueſs; for my Spouſe's Petition was delivered to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Barbeſieux,</hi> and, as I was fully convinced, what Entertainment ſhe would meet with, if ſhe came to him for an Anſwer, I would not put her to the trouble of it. The Governor of the <hi>Baſtile</hi> being not ignorant how her Affairs went at Court, and underſtanding that ſhe had taken a Reſolution to throw herſelf a ſecond time at His Majeſty's Feet to beg his Mercy, in order to my Relief, without being forced to have recourſe to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, he adviſed her by all means, not to do it; for he was not a little affraid, leſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, according to his wonted Bounty, ſhould grant to a diſtreſſed Foreigner, what he would not do upon any other conſideration; eſpecially, if he might be prevailed upon to peruſe her Petition. This advice he ſeconded by another, which had not the leaſt colour of truth; but which, as malicious as it is, is altogether ſuitable to the honeſty of a Man of his Character, as I have had ſufficient occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſhew before. He was pleaſed to tell her, that he could not but admire, ſhe ſhould give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much trouble to releaſe me, which he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the direct way to reduce her and her Family to the laſt extremity, which ſhe could not be inſenſible of, if ſhe would but take the pains to make ſerious Reflections upon what was paſt; that ſhe ought to remember how by my ill Conduct I had entangled my Eſtate, and that I would never be at reſt till I had ſpent all, if I was ſet at Liberty; and that therefore his advice was, that it would be
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65930:195"/>
better both for herſelf and her Family to leave me where I was, where I ſtood her in nothing, and that at the ſame time he would take effectual care I ſhould be as well uſed as if I were his own Brother.</p>
               <p>My Spouſe was ſo extreamly exaſperated at his Impudence, that ſhe had much to do to forbear fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Face, and gave him ſuch a Reprimand as gave him to underſtand that ſhe was reſolved to do all what belonged to a Dutiful Wife to do upon ſuch an Emergency as this, notwithſtanding all his Pretences, and the next time ſhe ſaw me, ſhe gave me a very ample Account of what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, notwithſtanding one of his Officers was preſent at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>To conclude the whole, after ſhe had taken many a troubleſome Journey to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> in order to ſollicite my Releaſement with the King, and the Miniſters of State, finding all her pains loſt, and that ſhe was as far from the Mark as ever, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time drawing near, ſhe was forced to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country, without the leaſt hopes of ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my Liberty. For this reaſon it is, that I thought my ſelf obliged to publiſh theſe Memoirs, to ſatisfie the World, that if I happen to die in Priſon, it is not on the Account of any Crimes I have been guilty of againſt Mankind; for as to thoſe committed againſt God Almighty, I confeſs, they are ſuch as deſerve a much greater Puniſhment at his Hands.</p>
